feroxbuster is a tool designed to perform Forced Browsing.

Forced browsing is an attack where the aim is to enumerate and access resources that are not referenced by the web application, but are still accessible by an attacker.

feroxbuster uses brute force combined with a wordlist to search for unlinked content in target directories. These resources may store sensitive information about web applications and operational systems, such as source code, credentials, internal network addressing, etc...

This attack is also known as Predictable Resource Location, File Enumeration, Directory Enumeration, and Resource Enumeration.
‚è≥ Quick Start

This section will cover the minimum amount of information to get up and running with feroxbuster. Please refer the the documentation, as it's much more comprehensive.
üíø Installation

There are quite a few other installation methods, but these snippets should cover the majority of users.

sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y feroxbuster

Install to a particular directory

curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epi052/feroxbuster/main/install-nix.sh | bash -s $HOME/.local/bin

üß∞ Example Usage

Here are a few brief examples to get you started. Please note, feroxbuster can do a lot more than what's listed below. As a result, there are many more examples, with demonstration gifs that highlight specific features, in the documentation.
Multiple Values

Options that take multiple values are very flexible. Consider the following ways of specifying extensions:

./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 -x pdf -x js,html -x php txt json,docx

The command above adds .pdf, .js, .html, .php, .txt, .json, and .docx to each url

All of the methods above (multiple flags, space separated, comma separated, etc...) are valid and interchangeable. The same goes for urls, headers, status codes, queries, and size filters.
Include Headers

./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 -H Accept:application/json "Authorization: Bearer {token}"

IPv6, non-recursive scan with INFO-level logging enabled

./feroxbuster -u http://[::1] --no-recursion -vv

Read urls from STDIN; pipe only resulting urls out to another tool

cat targets | ./feroxbuster --stdin --silent -s 200 301 302 --redirects -x js | fff -s 200 -o js-files

Proxy traffic through Burp

./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --insecure --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080

Proxy traffic through a SOCKS proxy (including DNS lookups)

./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050
