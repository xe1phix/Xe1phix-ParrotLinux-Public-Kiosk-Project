---------------------------Type This-----------------------------------
cd ~/students/yourname/LinuxBasics

ls -l one
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
We can determine a lot from examining the results of this command. The file "one" is owned by user "me". 
Now "me" has the right to read and write this file. 
The file is owned by the group "me". Members of the group "me" can also read and write this file. 
Everybody else can read this file


---------------------------Type This-----------------------------------
ls -l /bin/bash
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we can see:

The file "/bin/bash" is owned by user "root". The superuser has the right to read, write, and execute this file. 
The file is owned by the group "root". Members of the group "root" can also read and execute this file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Everybody else can read and execute this file


The next command you need to know is "chmod"
rwx rwx rwx = 111 111 111
rw- rw- rw- = 110 110 110
rwx --- --- = 111 000 000

and so on...

rwx = 111 in binary = 7
rw- = 110 in binary = 6
r-x = 101 in binary = 5
r-- = 100 in binary = 4


---------------------------Type This-----------------------------------
ls -l one

chmod 600 one

ls -l one

sudo useradd yourname
	aegisweaponssystem


sudo passwd yourname

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a table of numbers that covers all the common settings. The ones beginning with "7" are used with programs (since they enable execution) and the rest are for other kinds of files.

Value	Meaning
777 (rwxrwxrwx) 	No restrictions on permissions. Anybody may do anything. Generally not a desirable setting.

755 (rwxr-xr-x) 	The file's owner may read, write, and execute the file. All others may read and execute the file. This setting is common for programs that are used by all users.

700 (rwx------) 	The file's owner may read, write, and execute the file. Nobody else has any rights. This setting is useful for programs that only the owner may use and must be kept private from others.

666 (rw-rw-rw-) 	All users may read and write the file.

644 (rw-r--r--) 	The owner may read and write a file, while all others may only read the file. A common setting for data files that everybody may read, but only the owner may change.

600 (rw-------) 	The owner may read and write a file. All others have no rights. A common setting for data files that the owner wants to keep private.



Directory permissions
---------------------
The chmod command can also be used to control the access permissions for directories. In most ways, the permissions scheme for directories works the same way as they do with files. However, the execution permission is used in a different way. It provides control for access to file listing and other things. Here are some useful settings for directories:

Value	Meaning
777 (rwxrwxrwx) 	No restrictions on permissions. 
Anybody may list files, create new files in the directory and delete files in the directory. 
Generally not a good setting.



755 (rwxr-xr-x) 	The directory owner has full access. 
All others may list the directory, but cannot create files nor delete them. 
This setting is common for directories that you wish to share with other users.



700 (rwx------) 	The directory owner has full access. Nobody else has any rights. This setting is useful for directories that only the owner may use and must be kept private from others.

The pkill command works in almost exactly the same way as kill, but it operates on a process name instead:

pkill -9 ping
The above command is the equivalent of:

kill -9 `pgrep ping`

# Log Analysis with Linux command-line tools #
##############################################
- The following command line executables are found in the Mac as well as most Linux Distributions.
 
cat –  prints the content of a file in the terminal window
grep – searches and filters based on patterns
awk –  can sort each row into fields and display only what is needed
sed –  performs find and replace functions
sort – arranges output in an order
uniq – compares adjacent lines and can report, filter or provide a count of duplicates

mkdir log_analysis
cd log_analysis
wget http://45.63.104.73/cisco.log
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


AWK Basics
----------
- To quickly demonstrate the print feature in awk, we can instruct it to show only the 5th word of each line. Here we will print $5. Only the last 4 lines are being shown for brevity.
---------------------------Type This----------------------------------- 
cat cisco.log | awk '{print $5}' | tail -n 4
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
- Looking at a large file would still produce a large amount of output. A more useful thing to do might be to output every entry found in “$5”, group them together, count them, then sort them from the greatest to least number of occurrences. This can be done by piping the output through “sort“, using “uniq -c” to count the like entries, then using “sort -rn” to sort it in reverse order.
---------------------------Type This----------------------------------- 
cat cisco.log | awk '{print $5}'| sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
- While that’s sort of cool, it is obvious that we have some garbage in our output. Evidently we have a few lines that aren’t conforming to the output we expect to see in $5. We can insert grep to filter the file prior to feeding it to awk. This insures that we are at least looking at lines of text that contain “facility-level-mnemonic”.
---------------------------Type This----------------------------------- 
cat cisco.log | grep %[a-zA-Z]*-[0-9]-[a-zA-Z]* | awk '{print $5}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
 
- Now that the output is cleaned up a bit, it is a good time to investigate some of the entries that appear most often. One way to see all occurrences is to use grep.
---------------------------Type This----------------------------------- 
cat cisco.log | grep %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN:
 
cat cisco.log | grep %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN:| awk '{print $10}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
 
cat cisco.log | grep %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN:| sed 's/,//g' | awk '{print $10}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
 
cat cisco.log | grep %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN:| sed 's/,//g' | awk '{print $10 " changed to " $14}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
