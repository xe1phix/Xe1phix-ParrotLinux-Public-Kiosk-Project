ACCOUNTING FOR TASKS IN THE BUG TRACKER

There must be at least one task assigned to you at any given moment in the "In Progress" status.

If you are working on a project alone, you create the tasks and keep the records yourself.
For a project in development, this means you need to present the work plan in the form of tasks,
break down a large task into subtasks, give time estimates for them.
For a support project, these are ongoing routine tasks.

Otherwise, the tasks are created by your technical supervisor.

Give the task a runtime estimate, when created.

Change the status of the task when you take it to work, send it for a test or review.

The task must have a performer!

The statuses "Test" and "Review" are assigned to the task only if it is relevant to this project.

IN OPERATION -> TESTING When a task is put to testing, a tester becomes the executor.
TEST -> IN OPERATION When a task is returned for revision, the developer becomes the executor.
When a task is placed in "ready" status, the task is assigned to a project manager.

For testing tasks, there must always be a primary task:
- for development (something the developer has been working on and now needs to test it)
- or a regular daily test (builds to be checked daily/regularly).
In the first case, the developer transfers the task to the tester, the task is closed after acceptance.
In the second case, the task can be open forever (with the assignment to the tester), in it goes the time and notes.

Note the progress of the task.

Make a note of the time you spend every day.

If you want to attach a file (log, screenshot, etc.), you physically attach the file to the task.
It is FORBIDDEN to provide links to file sharing sites.

Keep work notes in the comments to the task.
If there is a difficult problem on the way to the goal,
or you've found a solution to a problem,
or if you have a question, write a comment.
Don't forget to link to the source of the solution.
