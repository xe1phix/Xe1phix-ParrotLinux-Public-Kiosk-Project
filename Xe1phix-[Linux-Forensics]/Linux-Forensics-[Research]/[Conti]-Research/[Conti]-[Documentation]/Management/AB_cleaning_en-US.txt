INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO REMOVE ANTIVIRUS DETECTIONS

1. When an AV detector is detected on a software (on any software, not necessarily this project), the developer:
- records in RELEASE NOTES date, name of AV, type of AV detection (static/dyncheck), name of detection(s).
If the detects are on more than one AB, attach the link c dyncheck.
Also writes special notes if any (everything you want to add - observations, conjectures, patterns).
- In the course of detection, describes the methods of detection that were used and the results achieved.

In short, when removing detects, a log should be kept with all the details in the file RELEASE_NOTES.txt of the project.
This is necessary for the exchange of experience between different developers, identification of the most effective methodology, as well as the accumulation of statistics on the AV operation.

2. The "researcher's quick start" describes in detail the principles of removal and all currently known factors.

3. To remove statics, you should use the avclean automatic detector scanner to save your time.
