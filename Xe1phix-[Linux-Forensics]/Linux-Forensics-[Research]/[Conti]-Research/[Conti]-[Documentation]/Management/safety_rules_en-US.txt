0. Use strong passwords.
At least 16 characters long, different character cases, alpha and numbers, punctuation marks and full ASCII alphabet.

1. You should transfer files to each other as an encrypted .rar archive with a password of at least 16 characters.
The password must be strong (see above).

THE ARCHIVE TABLE OF CONTENTS (FILE NAMES IN THE ARCHIVE) MUST BE ENCRYPTED.
This is a mandatory requirement.
File names say VERY much about you.

The name of the archive should not say anything.

modulename.22.09.2010.rar - bad name

c.rar or 1.rar is a good name

Avoid transferring files through privnote.com and similar services.
Remember that the transmitted text will remain in the server logs forever.

2.1 DO NOT OPEN other people's .doc, .docx, .xls, .pdf, .rtf, and so on - any files on your personal machine,
interpreted by the tuning-complete finite state machine (which almost all programs are).
These formats are used to plant viruses.
If you have to - virtual machine and virustotal to help.

Use the .txt format exclusively, and as an exception - images.

3. use TOR and/or VPN for any activity.
TOR is preferable, but not all sites are accessible through it.
Only use a VPN issued at work.

Check yourself on sites like whoer.net - how do you look to analysts?

4. The preferred browser is TOR Browser.
In second place is Mozilla Firefox with tracking protection enabled and telemetry disabled.

Do not use Chrome except for testing purposes.
Chrome was originally designed to spy on Google.

Find out how WebRTC is turned off in your browser. Your real IP is leaking through it!!!

Turn off telemetry and Google safe browsing in your browser.
Browser is dangerous for file transfers because it uses two channels to match source and destination of the file:
- Safe browsing (hash and link of the file is sent both when the file is uploaded to the network and when it is downloaded - at both recipients)
- Via local AB: FF/Chrome/Edge put into alternate streams of file information about where it was downloaded from:
[ZoneTransfer]
ZoneId=3
ReferrerUrl=http://www.nattyware.com/pixie.php
HostUrl=http://www.nattyware.com/bin/pixie.exe

In incognito mode:

[ZoneTransfer]
ZoneId=3
HostUrl=about:internet

5. Remember that trackers in browsers (like Google Analytics) give a complete picture of your online movements.
Therefore, only the TOR Browser.
Mozilla Firefox has anti-tracking protection, but it is not perfect.

Remember about browser fingerprints:

6. Make backups as often as possible.
Copy them to a separate medium, and store them separately.
Preferably, store the backup media in a different room.
The backup medium must be encrypted.

7. Encrypt the work partition, store work files in cryptocontainers.

8. Run received files only in a virtual machine with a rollback point configured.
Even from a virtual machine it is possible to leak your real IP address.

9. Check unknown files on services like VirusTotal, including documents.
Do not run anything obtained from the network on your personal computer.

10. Use different identities for different activities.
A unique nickname on the Internet is very bad.
Now there are automatic commercial scanners that scan a person by nickname or photo.
Use different nicknames on social networks, at work, and in other activities.

In social networks, it is better not to show up at all and do not put real data - photos, addresses, phone numbers, etc.
If you really need to, only under a pseudonym and with a left photo.

Learn to make up names and biographies.

Don't use your smartphone for anything work-related.
If you lose your smartphone or it gets stolen, then what?

12. don't talk.
