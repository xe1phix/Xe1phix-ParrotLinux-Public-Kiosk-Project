RULES FOR ERROR REPORTING

Copy this text, put Enter after each line, and answer the questions:
1. What did I want? (what was I trying to do)
2. What did I do? (detailed steps to reproduce)
3. what happened? (how did the system react)
4. What did I expect? (how I thought the system should have reacted)
5. What did I do to locate the error (what factors I varied to find the error)
6. Environment (version and size of OS, build and software involved; paths, specific settings, IP addresses and domains)
7. Logs and screenshots.

Be sure to attach any attachments to the bug, rather than giving them a link to a file-sharing site.
In a few days the link will go stale, and the bug is referred to years later.
