[27.06.2018 14:35] <buza>: now the task
[27.06.2018 14:35] <buza>: we also have support for ee and edge
[27.06.2018 14:35] <buza>: for edge the log itself is not created
[27.06.2018 14:36] <buza>: it needs to be created and properly assigned
[27.06.2018 14:36] <buza>: but we'll leave that for later
[27.06.2018 14:36] <buza>: Write a script on cmd that checks the following cases:
1) loader_is_not_broken (maintain loader.log)
2) loader_is_started (loader.log has the right patterns for normal start)
3) ff_injects (core-dll.log is kept, it has a normal startup pattern)
4) chrome_injects (core-dll.log is started, it has a normal startup pattern)
5) ie_injects (core-dll.log is started, it has a normal startup pattern)
6) edge_injects (core-dll.log is started, it has a normal startup pattern)
7) ff_grabs (there is a pattern for grabbing passwords and history).
8) ie_grabs (there is pattern of password and history grabber).
9) chrome_grabs (there is pattern of password and history grabber)
10) chrome_page_injects (opens specified page in browser, its inject pattern appears in log) ...
the same for other browsers In case the tests do not pass, this is a reason for the tester to return the build to the developer.

[27.06.2018 14:46] <buza>: log name must include current date-time, machine name
[27.06.2018 14:46] <buza>: log format
[27.06.2018 14:46] <buza>: date-time test name start
[27.06.2018 14:46] <buza>: date-time test name finish: Success / FAILED
[27.06.2018 14:46] <buza>: total tests passed
[27.06.2018 14:47] <buza>: total tests successful
[27.06.2018 14:47] <buza>: total tests failed
[27.06.2018 14:47] <buza>: language is probably better English, because not everywhere has Cyrillic
[27.06.2018 14:47] <buza>: ah yes
[27.06.2018 14:48] <buza>: also before a series of tests for each browser in the log should go browser version
