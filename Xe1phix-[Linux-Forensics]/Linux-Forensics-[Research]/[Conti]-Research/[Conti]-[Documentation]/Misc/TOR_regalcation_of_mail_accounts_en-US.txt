You need to write a script-registrar of mail accounts, with the following requirements:
- site: gmx.com
- Working through a randomly selected proxy socks5 (list of proxies is given as a text file)
Proxies are set in the form of

11.22.33.44:port

- The mandatory fields (first name, last name, state, etc.) are filled in randomly. The values must be plausible.
You can use name dictionaries, etc.

The script must have a command line interface through which you can specify:
- file name with the list of proxies
- output file name with a list of created accounts email:password
- additional dictionary files for names, etc.
- number of accounts to register

The script should comment its actions on stdout/stderr, in approximately the following form:
