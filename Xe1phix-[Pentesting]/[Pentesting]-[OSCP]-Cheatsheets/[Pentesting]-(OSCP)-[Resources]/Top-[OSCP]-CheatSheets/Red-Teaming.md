	* We'll review what actions are taken in each phase, and what's necessary for the adversary to move from one phase to the next. We'll discuss multiple types of controls that you can implement today in your enterprise to frustrate the adversary's plan at each stage, to avoid needing to declare "game over" just because an adversary has gained access to the internal network. The primary limiting factor of the traditional Cyber Kill Chain is that it ends with Stage 7: Actions on Objectives, conveying that once the adversary reaches this stage and has access to a system on the internal network, the defending victim has already lost. In reality, there should be multiple layers of security zones on the internal network, to protect the most critical assets. The adversary often has to move through numerous additional phases in order to access and manipulate specific systems to achieve his objective. By increasing the time and effort required to move through these stages, we decrease the likelihood of the adversary causing material damage to the enterprise.

		* An effective red team exercise is substantially different from a penetration test, and it should be chartered differently as well. The scenario, objective, scope, and rules of engagement all need to be positioned correctly at the beginning in order to most closely simulate a real adversary and provide maximum value to the client.In this presentation, we'll review best practices in each of these areas, distilled from conducting dozens of successful red team exercises - along with some war stories highlighting why each element matters. Those in offensive security will gain an understanding of how to manage the client's expectations for this process, and how to guide them towards an engagement that provides a realistic measurement of their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to real attacks. Those in enterprise security will gain a deeper understanding of this style of assessment, and how to work with a red team to drive real improvement in their security programs.

		* This project consists of the hardware and software necessary to hijack wired network communications. The hardware allows an attacker to splice into live network cabling without ever breaking the physical connection. This allows the traffic on the line to be passively tapped and examined. Once the attacker has gained enough knowledge about the data being sent, the device switches to an active tap topology, where data in both directions can be modified on the fly. Through our custom implementation of the network stack, we can accurately mimic the two devices across almost all OSI layers. We have developed several applications for this technology. Most notable is the editing of live video streams to produce a “camera loop,” that is, hijacking the feed from an Ethernet surveillance camera so that the same footage repeats over and over again. More advanced video transformations can be applied if necessary. This attack can be executed and activated with practically no interruption in service, and when deactivated, is completely transparent.

		* Laser listening devices (laser microphones) are a well understood technology. They have historically been used in the surreptitious surveillance of protected spaces. Using such a device, an attacker bounces an infrared laser off of a reflective surface, and receives the ricocheted beam with a photoreceptor. If the beam is reflected from a surface that is vibrating due to sound (voice is a typical background target), that sound is subsequently modulated into the beam and can be demodulated at the receptor. This is a known attack method and will be briefly discussed. However, does this principle also hold for non-amplified or naturally concentrated light sources? Can one retrieve modulated audio from reflected sunlight? The idea of modulating voice with sunlight was pioneered by Alexander Graham Bell in 1880 with an invention called the Photophone. A Photophone uses the audio modulation concept now used in laser microphones, but relied on a concentrated beam of sunlight rather than a laser to communicate at distance. Considering that Bell proved that intentionally concentrated sunlight can be used to modulate voice, we will explore under what natural conditions modulated audio can be found in reflected ambient light. Using off the shelf solar-cells and handmade amplifiers, Erik will demonstrate the use of the receiver side of a historic Photophone to identify instances of modulated audio in reflected light under common conditions.

		* My last 3 years of global reteaming in small and large organisations has shown me that there still are a lot of misconceptions about security. We all know the ‘onion’ model for layered security. While useful for the ‘defence in depth’ principle, this talk will show that in reality, rather than an onion, security is more like a pyramid. The basis is the hardware people work on (laptops etc.) and the top your business applications. In between is everything else. Operating system, network components, proxies, shares, servers and their software stack. Like any hi-rise structure, the top cannot be secure if the base is not secure. Defence in depth matters, but it can be quite trivial for attackers to sidestep certain controls to get to the data they want. Just securing your ‘crown-jewels’ is insufficient. This talk will revolve around how we have defeated security controls on various levels, ranging from the systems your end-users work on, all the way through to 2FA and 4-eye principles on critical business assets. It will talk about common misconceptions which lull companies into a false sense of security, while making life far too easy for attackers. For example the fallacy of focussing security efforts only/mostly on ‘crown jewels’ and how misunderstanding of why certain controls are put in place jeopardize corporate and client data. The talk will be supported by real-life examples

	* Dismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a person to know critical secrets does not lessen the impact on life, work, and relationships of building a different map of reality than “normal people” use. One has to calibrate narratives to what another believes. One has to live defensively, warily. This causes at the least cognitive dissonance which some manage by denial. But refusing to feel the pain does not make it go away. It just intensifies the consequences when they erupt. Philip K. Dick said, reality is that which, when you no longer believe in it, does not go away. When cognitive dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress, one ignores those symptoms at one’s peril. But the very constraints of one’s work often make it impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms, because that might threaten one’s clearances, work, and career. And whistle blower protection is often non-existent.

	* [emptynest](https://github.com/empty-nest/emptynest)
		* Emptynest is a plugin based C2 server framework. The goal of this project is not to replace robust tools such as Empire, Metasploit, or Cobalt Strike. Instead, the goal is to create a supporting framework for quickly creating small, purpose built handlers for custom agents. No agent is provided. Users of Emptynest should create their own agents that implement minimal functionality and can be used to evade detection and establish a more robust channel. An example of an agent might support Unhooking, DLL Unloading, and code execution. Due to the simple nature of this project, it is recommended that agents be kept private.
	* [RemoteRecon](https://github.com/xorrior/RemoteRecon)
		* RemoteRecon provides the ability to execute post-exploitation capabilities against a remote host, without having to expose your complete toolkit/agent. Often times as operator's we need to compromise a host, just so we can keylog or screenshot (or some other miniscule task) against a person/host of interest. Why should you have to push over beacon, empire, innuendo, meterpreter, or a custom RAT to the target? This increases the footprint that you have in the target environment, exposes functionality in your agent, and most likely your C2 infrastructure. An alternative would be to deploy a secondary agent to targets of interest and collect intelligence. Then store this data for retrieval at your discretion. If these compromised endpoints are discovered by IR teams, you lose those endpoints and the information you've collected, but nothing more.

		* Covert channels are used for the secret transfer of information. Encryption only protects communication from being decoded by unauthorised parties, whereas covert channels aim to hide the very existence of the communication. Initially, covert channels were identified as a security threat on monolithic systems i.e. mainframes. More recently focus has shifted towards covert channels in computer network protocols. The huge amount of data and vast number of different protocols in the Internet seems ideal as a high-bandwidth vehicle for covert communication. This article is a survey of the existing techniques for creating covert channels in widely deployed network and application protocols. We also give an overview of common methods for their detection, elimination, and capacity limitation, required to improve security in future computer networks.

			* Abstract: In this paper we propose an extremely stealthy approach for implementing hardware Trojans below the gate level, and we evaluate their impact on the security of the target device. Instead of adding additional circuitry to the target design, we insert our hardware Trojans by changing the dopant polarity of existing transistors. Since the modied circuit ap- pears legitimate on all wiring layers (including all metal and polysilicon), our family of Trojans is resistant to most detection techniques, including negrain optical inspection and checking against \golden chips". We demonstrate the e ectiveness of our approach by inserting Trojans into two designs | a digital post-processing derived from Intel's cryptographically secure RNG design used in the Ivy Bridge processors and a side-channel resistant SBox implementation | and by exploring their detectability and their effects on security.
		* [Implementation and Implications of a Stealth Hard-Drive Backdoor](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/kurmus/papers/acsac13.pdf) 
			* Modern workstations and servers implicitly trust hard disks to act as well-behaved block devices. This paper analyzes the catastrophic loss of security that occurs when hard disks are not trustworthy. First, we show that it is possible to compromise the firmware of a commercial ovt-the-shelf hard drive, by resorting only to public information and reverse engineering. Using such a compromised firmware, we present a stealth rootkit that replaces arbitrary blocks from the disk while they are written, providing a data replacement back- door . The measured performance overhead of the compromised disk drive is less than 1% compared with a normal, non-malicious disk drive. We then demonstrate that a re- mote attacker can even establish a communication channel with a compromised disk to infiltrate commands and to ex-filtrate data. In our example, this channel is established over the Internet to an unmodified web server that relies on the compromised drive for its storage, passing through the original webserver, database server, database storage engine, filesystem driver, and block device driver. Additional experiments, performed in an emulated disk-drive environment, could automatically extract sensitive data such as /etc/shadow (or a secret key le) in less than a minute. This paper claims that the diffculty of implementing such an at- tack is not limited to the area of government cyber-warfare; rather, it is well within the reach of moderately funded criminals, botnet herders and academic researchers.

TAP was designed to make the deployment of these boxes super simple and create a self-healing and stable platform to deploy remote penetration testing platforms. Essentially the concept is simple, you pre-configure a brand new box and run the TAP setup file. This will install a service on Linux that will be configured the way you want. What it will do is establish a reverse SSH tunnel back to a machine thats exposed on the Internet for you. From there you can access the box locally from the server it connects back to. TAP automatically detects when an SSH connection has gone stale and will automatically rebuild it for you.

### <a name="payload"></a>Payloads
* **Development**
	* [covertutils - A framework for Backdoor development!](https://github.com/operatorequals/covertutils)
		* This Python package is used to create Agent/Handler backdoors, like metasploit's meterpreter, empire's empire agent, cobalt strike's beacon and so on... It automatically handles all communication channel options, like encryption, chunking, steganography, sessions, etc. With a recent package addition (httpimport), staging from pure Python2/3 is finally possible! With all those set with a few lines of code, a programmer can spend time creating the actual payloads, persistense mechanisms, shellcodes and generally more creative stuff!! The security programmers can stop re-inventing the wheel by implementing encryption mechanisms both Agent-side and Handler-side to spend their time developing more versatile Agents, and generally feature-rich shells!
* **Tools**
	* [Demiguise](https://github.com/nccgroup/demiguise)
		* The aim of this project is to generate .html files that contain an encrypted HTA file. The idea is that when your target visits the page, the key is fetched and the HTA is decrypted dynamically within the browser and pushed directly to the user. This is an evasion technique to get round content / file-type inspection implemented by some security-appliances. This tool is not designed to create awesome HTA content. There are many other tools/techniques that can help you with that. What it might help you with is getting your HTA into an environment in the first place, and (if you use environmental keying) to avoid it being sandboxed.
	* [SharpShooter](https://github.com/mdsecactivebreach/SharpShooter)
		* SharpShooter is a payload creation framework for the retrieval and execution of arbitrary CSharp source code. SharpShooter is capable of creating payloads in a variety of formats, including HTA, JS, VBS and WSF. It leverages James Forshaw's DotNetToJavaScript tool to invoke methods from the SharpShooter DotNet serialised object. Payloads can be retrieved using Web or DNS delivery or both; SharpShooter is compatible with the MDSec ActiveBreach PowerDNS project. Alternatively, stageless payloads with embedded shellcode execution can also be generated for the same scripting formats.
* **Examples/Samples**
	* [Invoke-BSOD](https://github.com/peewpw/Invoke-BSOD)

* **Keying Payloads**
	* [Context-keyed Payload Encoding](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=42&t=sumry)
		* A common goal of payload encoders is to evade a third-party detection mechanism which is actively observing attack traffic somewhere along the route from an attacker to their target, filtering on commonly used payload instructions. The use of a payload encoder may be easily detected and blocked as well as opening up the opportunity for the payload to be decoded for further analysis. Even so-called keyed encoders utilize easily observable, recoverable, or guessable key values in their encoding algorithm, thus making decoding on-the-fly trivial once the encoding algorithm is identified. It is feasible that an active observer may make use of the inherent functionality of the decoder stub to decode the payload of a suspected exploit in order to inspect the contents of that payload and make a control decision about the network traffic. This paper presents a new method of keying an encoder which is based entirely on contextual information that is predictable or known about the target by the attacker and constructible or recoverable by the decoder stub when executed at the target. An active observer of the attack traffic however should be unable to decode the payload due to lack of the contextual keying information.
	* [Keying Payloads for Scripting Languages](https://adapt-and-attack.com/2017/11/15/keying-payloads-for-scripting-languages/)

		* IBM System Z Mainframes are in regular use in Fortune 500 companies. Far from being legacy these systems are running an actively maintained operating system (z/OS). Applications on these often occupy roles critical to the business processes they underpin, with much of the later technology built around them, rather than replacing them. However, these systems are often bypassed by security testing due to worried of availability or assumptions about legacy. This talk will introduce you to assessing mainframe applications, which turn out to be quite similar to web applications. For this purpose we built a tool, Big Iron Recon & Pwnage (BIRP), to assist with performing such assessments. Importantly, our research uncovered a family of mainframe application vulnerabilities introduced by the TN3270 protocol. We found numerous applications, but not all, vulnerable to these flaws. Applications running within the two most popular transaction managers (CICS and IMS) as well as one of IBM’s own applications. The tool released assists with the exploitation of these flaws.

	* [Hacking Virtual Appliances - Jeremy Brown - Derbycon2015](https://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon5/fix-me08-hacking-virtual-appliances-jeremy-brown)
		* Virtual Appliances have become very prevalent these days as virtualization is ubiquitous and hypervisors commonplace. More and more of the major vendors are providing literally virtual clones for many of their once physical-only products. Like IoT and the CAN bus, it's early in the game and vendors are late as usual. One thing that it catching these vendors off guard is the huge additional attack surface, ripe with vulnerabilities, added in the process. Also, many vendors see software appliances as an opportunity for the customer to easily evaluate the product before buying the physical one, making these editions more accessible and debuggable by utilizing features of the platform on which it runs. During this talk, I will provide real case studies for various vulnerabilities created by mistakes that many of the major players made when shipping their appliances. You'll learn how to find these bugs yourself and how the vendors went about fixing them, if at all. By the end of this talk, you should have a firm grasp of how one goes about getting remotes on these appliances.
