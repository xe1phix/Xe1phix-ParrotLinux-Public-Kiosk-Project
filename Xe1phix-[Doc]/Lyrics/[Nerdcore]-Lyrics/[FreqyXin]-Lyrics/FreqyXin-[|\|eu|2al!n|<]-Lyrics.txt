Push notice
Blowing up my phone
You’re in town for business
Got some time to be alone

Tell yourself
That you hired me right
Thought you found one
Too helpless for a fight

But now
my boot across your throat
Struggling for air
Time to lose all hope

Cyberpunk chick
What did you expect
Empty out your bank accounts
your life’s a fucking wreck

Cybernetic implants
Make you dance
Hack your fucking brain
Make your consciousness halt crash

Neuralink connect
direct line
download all your fucked-up dreams
your memories are mine

Inject malicious data to your stream
black mirror episode
make you wanna scream

But freqy not done with you yet
Make your brain reset
Now you acting like my pet

lonely hacker girl
Late night Bit bangin
yung beat
Innanet chat room hangin
Used to be Backpage
to make my cash
Now I’m dumping /etc/shadow
