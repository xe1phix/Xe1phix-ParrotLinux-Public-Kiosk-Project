Fucking with the code yea I forgot to sleep
Fucking with the music I forgot to eat
Snacking on your packets
cybercrime rackets
burning out my cell
so the feds cant track it

Talking to myself like
Oh yeah I need it
Gotta hack that
You know I bleed it
Typing out commands
Counting up the bands
Popping network creds
Make a Pcap expand

Red flags I don’t see them
Red team yeah we be them
Gotta hit your network
Putting in that nerd work
Stacking up tokens
Gonna make your girl twerk

Distracted boyfriend
Like ew you meme it
Break it down baby
Like lets double team it
Freqy little lifestyle
Make a black hat smile
-T1 baby
take a little while

I stand
I cry
I lie
I take
I Wonder when a better day gonna break

I grind
I roll
I light
I take
I Wonder when a better day gonna break

Fucking with my mind I forgot to sleep
Fucking with my heart I forgot to eat
Traffic while im online
Ducking out the trapline
Sneaking past a firewall
Never break a Baseline

Doing cam work but
I don’t need it
Found a datasheet
Learned to read it
Over air commands
Deciphering the stands
Real time data flow
Waveform expands

Elevating priv yeah I’ll just ask
Escalating love through a subnet mask
Wifi waifu
Never gonna hurt you
Brute force baby
Got that numb heart passthrough

Talking to myself like
Oh yeah I need it
Gotta hack that
You know I bleed it
TCP dumping
Throughput bumping
Noisy exploit
Got the IDS jumping

I stand
I cry
I lie
I take
I Wonder when a better day gonna break

I grind
I roll
I light
I take
I Wonder when a better day gonna break
