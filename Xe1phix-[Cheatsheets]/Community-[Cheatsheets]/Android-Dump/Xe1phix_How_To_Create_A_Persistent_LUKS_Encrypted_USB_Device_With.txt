Title: How To Create A Persistent, LUKS Encrypted USB With A LUKS Killswitch Using Parrot Linux


In this presentation, I will cover:
 > Securely wipe files/device partitions (6 different methods).
 > Format the USB device with Parrot Linux hybrid ISO.
 > Create an Ext3 filesystem on the persistent partition.
 > Create LUKS encrypted container on the persistent partition.
 > Create a mount point, and mount the new LUKS encrypted partition.
 > Dump the header information of a LUKS device.
 > Add a nuke slot to the LUKS header.
 > Create a binary backup of the LUKS header and keyslot area.
 > Encrypt the LUKS header with OpenSSL for secure storage.
 > Decrypt the LUKS header with OpenSSL for secure storage.
 > Erase all LUKS key slots on persistant partition.
 > Restore LUKS header from binary backup file.
