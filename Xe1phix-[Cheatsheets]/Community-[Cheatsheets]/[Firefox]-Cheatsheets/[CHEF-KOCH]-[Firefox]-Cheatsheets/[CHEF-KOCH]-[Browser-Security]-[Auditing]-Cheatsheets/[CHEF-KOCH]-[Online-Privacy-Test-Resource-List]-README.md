## Privacy Online Test And Resource Compendium

The list is designed to show all available and useful online/offline tests in order to build strategies to harden your OS/Internet/Browser configuration against fingerprinting methods. Some of those services might collect only data to hand/sell it to 3th-party developer or people which pay for it to use it for 'bad' things, such services are (if known) marked and aren't preferable added - so keep this in mind before you request a site.

POTARC itself is more a community driven project because everyone can contribute to it and no pull request or discussion will be rejected, only with good reasons like spamming, etc. This project does not accept any donations because we all doing this in our free time and it's up to everyone to provide some information or not, from my perspective the information should be available for free.

Keep in mind that reducing the fingerprint doesn't mean you're secured against all attacks (including new upcoming ones) because security is a process and not something you gain by installing the correct extensions, plugins or programs.

## Contribution

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Online-Privacy-Test-Resource-List/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Before you create a new issue ticket, ensure you read the issue template and check if the things you like to request is not already on the todo list in order to avoid duplicates or already known things.


## How to handle these information and test results?

Collection of [device fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint) from web clients such as browser software mostly relies on the availability of JavaScript or similar client-side scripting language for the harvesting of a suitably large number of parameters. Overall this means if only one or a small of things are detectable it not automatically reveals your real identify, but all together can be pretty dangerous in order to expose you or your security setup. Keep in mind that it's not a good idea to share the results or to leak information which setup you exactly use.

The document section is for research and evidence purposes, topics without any proof are not reliable and the project doesn't accept any submissions without any documents or research based on the matter.

#### Keep in mind
> Some of the integrated services & pages collect the results and store it offline and some other pages even sell the results to 3rd-parties! I'm not responsible for this behavior, the list added an indicator in order to inform you.


### Research documents

I'm not the original author of any uploaded .pdf file in this repository, nor do I claim I wrote them. The documents are not under any license and the credit goes to the people which orignally written them. The documents are only mirrored here because several search engines (sadly) delete or hiding content behind proxies/VPN's, or the original link simply vanishes. All research documents are untouched. Please contact me via eMail if you don't like it and I'm going to remove them from this repository.

### Known Fingerprinting Techniques
* CDN [Web Cache Deception Attack based attacks](https://omergil.blogspot.ch/2017/02/web-cache-deception-attack.html). CDN's are in general a security problem, once infected or compromised you have no chance to identify the threat or not before it's already too late. [Decentraleyes](https://github.com/Synzvato/decentraleyes) reduce the attack surface.
* Fake identity, identify theft (not fixable) [NETSEC] & fake comments (OPSEC)
* Hardware implemented fingerprint methods such as [hardware based DRM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/hardware-drm) (wont-fix but can be configured via flags)
* Power consumption 'attacks' and wave signal based tests (not fixable without breaking the signals or updating the RFCs).
* Several [HTTP authorization detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_testing#Authentication) which is not fixable because it's protocol and meta-data depending and would require new metadata less protocols.

### Already fixed within the Browser or OS (ensure you use the latest product [always!])
* Browser based download attacks by exposing sensible information, there are several anti-fingerprinting techniques to expose you via drive-by.
* CPU & Mouse wheel fingerprinting which needs to be fixed also within the OS (wont-fix!)
* First-party cookies in general, daily pages like e.g. Amazon/Facebook (as an example) need cookies to function probably (addons/filter-lists may help to whitelist/bypass certain restrictions). Some pages like [Facebook already started to track user via first-party cookies](https://marketingland.com/facebook-to-release-first-party-pixel-for-ads-web-analytics-from-browsers-like-safari-249478).
* HTML5 based attacks which inclduing stuff like Canvas, fonts & more (will never be fixed, you have to use in order to spoof such data, however "configuration hardening" might help to reduce the surface attack level).
* ~~HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) sniffing attacks (removed/fixed in Chrome 72+ & Firefox 56+)~~
* Network layer based leaks (OSI leaks) e.g. MAC address leakage (EUI64). Disabling/blocking IPv6, if not necessary/needed is usually enough. See [RFC 3041](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3041) & ([leak test](http://ipv6leak.com/))
* Classic PopUps aren't possible anymore (if not Canvas/JS related). Normally you'll see a permission dialog or can control this behavior directly via Browser settings. Some [Browsers also come with their own Ads-blocking feature](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/14/17011266/google-chrome-ad-blocker-features).
* ~~Third-party cookie "isolation" or blocking~~
* Tor network attacks - several fingerprint methods are still possible. 
* ~~WebRTC since Chrome 48+ and Firefox 42+, both getting an new menu to allow it per-page (whitelist). There exist also for both several addons, workarounds to compile it without WebRTC support). [Unofficial Chromium builds](http://chromium.woolyss.com) also come without WebRTC or sync.~~
* ~~* Detection of incognito mode~~
* ~~Adobe Flash~~ (EOL), replaced by HTML5 (which has it's own _weaknesses_ [see below])
* ~~File Transfer Protocol (FTP)~~ - Will be removed soon or later from every Browser.
* ~~OpenSSL fixed (HeartBleed,CloudBleed...)~~
* ~~SSL / TLS (ciphers) [if you only browse on pages like GitHub ~ you can even more [harden it](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sheffer-tls-bcp-00)]~~ TLS 1.3 (3.0+) is the new common default and most platforms abandoned TLS 1.0/1.1/1.2.
* ~~SensorID fingerprinting attacks~~ fixed in iOS 12.2+ and it will be fixed in Android Q.
* ~~Coin Mining~~
* ~~BatteryAPI~~ based fingerprinting attacks
* ~~Spectre & Meltdown~~ Via OS & BIOS patches. Almost all modern Browser also protecting their memory against exfiltration attacks.
* ~~Several timing based attacks are too ineffective for an advertiser/attack to abuse (in the real world).~~
