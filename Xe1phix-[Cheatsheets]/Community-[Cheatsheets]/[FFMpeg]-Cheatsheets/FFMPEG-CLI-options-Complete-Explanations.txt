3. Options

All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept in input a string representing a number, which may contain one of the International System number postfixes, for example 'K', 'M', 'G'. If 'i' is appended after the postfix, powers of 2 are used instead of powers of 10. The 'B' postfix multiplies the value for 8, and can be appended after another postfix or used alone. This allows using for example 'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as postfix.

Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing with "no" the option name, for example using "-nofoo" in the commandline will set to false the boolean option with name "foo".

3.1 Generic options

These options are shared amongst the ff* tools.

`-L'
Show license.
`-h, -?, -help, --help'

Decoding available
`E'
Encoding available
`-codecs'
Show available codecs. The fields preceding the codec names have the following meanings:
`D'
Decoding available
`E'
Encoding available

`-protocols'
Show available protocols.
`-filters'
Show available libavfilter filters.
`-pix_fmts'
Show available pixel formats.

`quiet'
`panic'
`fatal'
`error'
`warning'
`info'
`verbose'
`debug'
By default the program logs to stderr, if coloring is supported by the terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log coloring can be disabled setting the environment variable @env{FFMPEG_FORCE_NOCOLOR} or @env{NO_COLOR}, or can be forced setting the environment variable @env{FFMPEG_FORCE_COLOR}. The use of the environment variable @env{NO_COLOR} is deprecated and will be dropped in a following FFmpeg version.
3.2 Main options

`-f fmt'
Force format.
`-i filename'
input file name
`-y'
Overwrite output files.
`-t duration'
Restrict the transcoded/captured video sequence to the duration specified in seconds. hh:mm:ss[.xxx] syntax is also supported.
`-fs limit_size'
Set the file size limit.
`-ss position'
Seek to given time position in seconds. hh:mm:ss[.xxx] syntax is also supported.
`-itsoffset offset'
Set the input time offset in seconds. [-]hh:mm:ss[.xxx] syntax is also supported. This option affects all the input files that follow it. The offset is added to the timestamps of the input files. Specifying a positive offset means that the corresponding streams are delayed by 'offset' seconds.
`-timestamp time'
Set the recording timestamp in the container. The syntax for time is:
now|([(YYYY-MM-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH[:MM[:SS[.m...]]])|(HH[MM[SS[.m...]]]))[Z|z])
If the value is "now" it takes the current time. Time is local time unless 'Z' or 'z' is appended, in which case it is interpreted as UTC. If the year-month-day part is not specified it takes the current year-month-day.
`-metadata key=value'
Set a metadata key/value pair. For example, for setting the title in the output file:
ffmpeg -i in.avi -metadata title="my title" out.flv
`-v number'
Set the logging verbosity level.
`-target type'
Specify target file type ("vcd", "svcd", "dvd", "dv", "dv50", "pal-vcd", "ntsc-svcd", ... ). All the format options (bitrate, codecs, buffer sizes) are then set automatically. You can just type:
ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd /tmp/vcd.mpg
Nevertheless you can specify additional options as long as you know they do not conflict with the standard, as in:
ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd -bf 2 /tmp/vcd.mpg
`-dframes number'
Set the number of data frames to record.
`-scodec codec'
Force subtitle codec ('copy' to copy stream).
`-newsubtitle'

`sqcif'
128x96
`qcif'
176x144

`-aspect aspect'
Set aspect ratio (4:3, 16:9 or 1.3333, 1.7777).
`-croptop size'
`-cropbottom size'
`-cropleft size'
`-cropright size'
All the crop options have been removed. Use -vf crop=width:height:x:y instead.
`-padtop size'
`-padbottom size'
`-padleft size'
`-padright size'
`-padcolor hex_color'

`-bt tolerance'
Set video bitrate tolerance (in bits, default 4000k). Has a minimum value of: (target_bitrate/target_framerate). In 1-pass mode, bitrate tolerance specifies how far ratecontrol is willing to deviate from the target average bitrate value. This is not related to min/max bitrate. Lowering tolerance too much has an adverse effect on quality.
`-maxrate bitrate'
Set max video bitrate (in bit/s). Requires -bufsize to be set.
`-minrate bitrate'
Set min video bitrate (in bit/s). Most useful in setting up a CBR encode:
ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -b 4000k -minrate 4000k -maxrate 4000k -bufsize 1835k out.m2v
It is of little use elsewise.
`-bufsize size'
Set video buffer verifier buffer size (in bits).
`-vcodec codec'
Force video codec to codec. Use the copy special value to tell that the raw codec data must be copied as is.
`-sameq'
Use same video quality as source (implies VBR).
`-pass n'
Select the pass number (1 or 2). It is used to do two-pass video encoding. The statistics of the video are recorded in the first pass into a log file (see also the option -passlogfile), and in the second pass that log file is used to generate the video at the exact requested bitrate. On pass 1, you may just deactivate audio and set output to null, examples for Windows and Unix:
ffmpeg -i foo.mov -vcodec libxvid -pass 1 -an -f rawvideo -y NUL
ffmpeg -i foo.mov -vcodec libxvid -pass 1 -an -f rawvideo -y /dev/null
`-passlogfile prefix'
Set two-pass log file name prefix to prefix, the default file name prefix is "ffmpeg2pass". The complete file name will be `PREFIX-N.log', where N is a number specific to the output stream.
`-newvideo'
Add a new video stream to the current output stream.
`-vlang code'
Set the ISO 639 language code (3 letters) of the current video stream.
`-vf filter_graph'

ffmpeg -i h264.mp4 -vcodec copy -vbsf h264_mp4toannexb -an out.h264
`-force_key_frames time[,time...]'
Force key frames at the specified timestamps, more precisely at the first frames after each specified time. This option can be useful to ensure that a seek point is present at a chapter mark or any other designated place in the output file. The timestamps must be specified in ascending order.
3.5 Audio Options

`-aframes number'
Set the number of audio frames to record.
`-ar freq'
Set the audio sampling frequency (default = 44100 Hz).
`-ab bitrate'
Set the audio bitrate in bit/s (default = 64k).
`-aq q'
Set the audio quality (codec-specific, VBR).
`-ac channels'
Set the number of audio channels. For input streams it is set by default to 1, for output streams it is set by default to the same number of audio channels in input. If the input file has audio streams with different channel count, the behaviour is undefined.
`-an'
Disable audio recording.
`-acodec codec'
Force audio codec to codec. Use the copy special value to specify that the raw codec data must be copied as is.
`-newaudio'
Add a new audio track to the output file. If you want to specify parameters, do so before -newaudio (-acodec, -ab, etc..). Mapping will be done automatically, if the number of output streams is equal to the number of input streams, else it will pick the first one that matches. You can override the mapping using -map as usual. Example:
ffmpeg -i file.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec ac3 -ab 384k test.mpg -acodec mp2 -ab 192k -newaudio
`-alang code'
Set the ISO 639 language code (3 letters) of the current audio stream.
3.6 Advanced Audio options:

`-atag fourcc/tag'
Force audio tag/fourcc.
`-absf bitstream_filter'
Bitstream filters available are "dump_extra", "remove_extra", "noise", "mp3comp", "mp3decomp".
3.7 Subtitle options:

`-scodec codec'
Force subtitle codec ('copy' to copy stream).
`-newsubtitle'
Add a new subtitle stream to the current output stream.
`-slang code'
Set the ISO 639 language code (3 letters) of the current subtitle stream.
`-sn'
Disable subtitle recording.
`-sbsf bitstream_filter'
Bitstream filters available are "mov2textsub", "text2movsub".
ffmpeg -i file.mov -an -vn -sbsf mov2textsub -scodec copy -f rawvideo sub.txt
3.8 Audio/Video grab options

`-vc channel'
Set video grab channel (DV1394 only).
`-tvstd standard'
Set television standard (NTSC, PAL (SECAM)).
`-isync'
Synchronize read on input.
3.9 Advanced options

`-map input_stream_id[:sync_stream_id]'
Set stream mapping from input streams to output streams. Just enumerate the input streams in the order you want them in the output. sync_stream_id if specified sets the input stream to sync against.
`-map_meta_data outfile[,metadata]:infile[,metadata]'
Set meta data information of outfile from infile. Note that those are file indices (zero-based), not filenames. Optional metadata parameters specify, which metadata to copy - (g)lobal (i.e. metadata that applies to the whole file), per-(s)tream, per-(c)hapter or per-(p)rogram. All metadata specifiers other than global must be followed by the stream/chapter/program number. If metadata specifier is omitted, it defaults to global. By default, global metadata is copied from the first input file to all output files, per-stream and per-chapter metadata is copied along with streams/chapters. These default mappings are disabled by creating any mapping of the relevant type. A negative file index can be used to create a dummy mapping that just disables automatic copying. For example to copy metadata from the first stream of the input file to global metadata of the output file:
ffmpeg -i in.ogg -map_meta_data 0:0,s0 out.mp3
`-map_chapters outfile:infile'
Copy chapters from infile to outfile. If no chapter mapping is specified, then chapters are copied from the first input file with at least one chapter to all output files. Use a negative file index to disable any chapter copying.
`-debug'
Print specific debug info.
`-benchmark'
Show benchmarking information at the end of an encode. Shows CPU time used and maximum memory consumption. Maximum memory consumption is not supported on all systems, it will usually display as 0 if not supported.
`-dump'
Dump each input packet.
`-hex'
When dumping packets, also dump the payload.
`-bitexact'
Only use bit exact algorithms (for codec testing).
`-ps size'
Set RTP payload size in bytes.
`-re'
Read input at native frame rate. Mainly used to simulate a grab device.
`-loop_input'
Loop over the input stream. Currently it works only for image streams. This option is used for automatic FFserver testing.
`-loop_output number_of_times'
Repeatedly loop output for formats that support looping such as animated GIF (0 will loop the output infinitely).
`-threads count'
Thread count.
`-vsync parameter'
Video sync method. 0 Each frame is passed with its timestamp from the demuxer to the muxer 1 Frames will be duplicated and dropped to achieve exactly the requested constant framerate. 2 Frames are passed through with their timestamp or dropped so as to prevent 2 frames from having the same timestamp -1 Chooses between 1 and 2 depending on muxer capabilities. This is the default method. With -map you can select from which stream the timestamps should be taken. You can leave either video or audio unchanged and sync the remaining stream(s) to the unchanged one.
`-async samples_per_second'
Audio sync method. "Stretches/squeezes" the audio stream to match the timestamps, the parameter is the maximum samples per second by which the audio is changed. -async 1 is a special case where only the start of the audio stream is corrected without any later correction.
`-copyts'
Copy timestamps from input to output.
`-shortest'
Finish encoding when the shortest input stream ends.
`-dts_delta_threshold'
Timestamp discontinuity delta threshold.
`-muxdelay seconds'
Set the maximum demux-decode delay.
`-muxpreload seconds'
Set the initial demux-decode delay.
`-streamid output-stream-index:new-value'
Assign a new value to a stream's stream-id field in the next output file. All stream-id fields are reset to default for each output file. For example, to set the stream 0 PID to 33 and the stream 1 PID to 36 for an output mpegts file:
ffmpeg -i infile -streamid 0:33 -streamid 1:36 out.ts
3.10 Preset files

A preset file contains a sequence of option=value pairs, one for each line, specifying a sequence of options which would be awkward to specify on the command line. Lines starting with the hash ('#') character are ignored and are used to provide comments. Check the `ffpresets' directory in the FFmpeg source tree for examples.

Preset files are specified with the vpre, apre, spre, and fpre options. The fpre option takes the filename of the preset instead of a preset name as input and can be used for any kind of codec. For the vpre, apre, and spre options, the options specified in a preset file are applied to the currently selected codec of the same type as the preset option.

The argument passed to the vpre, apre, and spre preset options identifies the preset file to use according to the following rules:

First ffmpeg searches for a file named arg.ffpreset in the directories `$FFMPEG_DATADIR' (if set), and `$HOME/.ffmpeg', and in the datadir defined at configuration time (usually `PREFIX/share/ffmpeg') in that order. For example, if the argument is libx264-max, it will search for the file `libx264-max.ffpreset'.

If no such file is found, then ffmpeg will search for a file named codec_name-arg.ffpreset in the above-mentioned directories, where codec_name is the name of the codec to which the preset file options will be applied. For example, if you select the video codec with -vcodec libx264 and use -vpre max, then it will search for the file `libx264-max.ffpreset'.
