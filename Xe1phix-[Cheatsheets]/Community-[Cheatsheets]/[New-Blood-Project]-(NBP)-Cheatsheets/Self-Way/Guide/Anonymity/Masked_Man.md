# The Masked Man

</br>

<p align="center">
Being Anonymous doesn't just end with wearing a mask... Our name comes from its own definition.
</br>
Anonymity is necessary to us for protection purposes.
</br>
Without this, we fall, and our whole life with it, perhaps the life of your loved ones too...
</br>
If you choose the voice of Anonymous, then master the art of anonymity.
</br>
There is no room for fame on this path..</p>

</p>

<p align="center">
An anonymous voice has an impact beyond the reach of any possible judgment by our conscience.
</br>
We cannot categorize an idea that has no owner. Each word become true and echo in themselves.

## 1. Behavior

``Always remember that YOU are your worse enemy's``

As long as you follow common sense like;

1. **Never do anything hacking related outside of your hacking environment**
2. **Never do any of your normal computer usage inside your hacking environment**
3. **Never mention any information about your real life when talking with other hackers**
4. **Never brag about your illegal hacking exploits to friends in real life**

*If you follow these rules, then you can pretty much do whatever you want with less risk of being in such situations you dont want.*

<p align="center">
   <img width="auto" height="auto" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64184513/184157060-587be764-b055-4858-b6b5-65916c2c7f71.gif"
</p>

* Privacy is the ability to keep things to yourself by choice, while anonymity means that you want people to see what you do, just not your identity.

* Always keep in mind that you dont know who is behind the screen; **wearing the picture of Anonymous does not mean the person is trustable. NEVER.**

* Of course, we are all human behind these masks, and nature being what it is; sometimes relationships slip from anonymity... a lot of the "doxxing" we see is the result. **So boys and girls, think twice.**

* For all the mistake you did in the past, you might be able to see them while Googling your name. To erase yourself from the result of Google please follow the steps described here: <https://www.security.org/digital-security/delete-personal-information-google/>

* DONT BE FOOL BY HONEYPOT

* The less you say, the harder it is for people to figure out what you’re doing. You do not want to give people an opportunity to take control of your actions or your life. So, in short; **keep your mouth close**.

</br>

## 2. Authentication

* Use a long, strong and unique password for each of your accounts (see HowSecureIsMyPassword.net)
* Use a secure password manager, to encrypt, store and fill credentials, such as BitWarden or KeePass / KeePassXC
* Enable 2-Factor authentication where available, and use an authenticator app or hardware token
* When you enable multi-factor authentication, you will usually be given several codes that you can use if your 2FA method is lost, broken or unavailable. You should store these on paper or in a safe place on disk (e.g. in offline storage or as in an encrypted file/drive).
* Sign up for breach alerts (with Firefox Monitor or HaveIBeenPwned), and update passwords of compromised accounts

## 3. What is considered as private data

```text
* Passwords
* Real, full (family) name
* Address of your home, workplace, or school
* Social Security number
* Government ID numbers (driver’s license number and passport number)
* Date and place of birth
* Biometric information (fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition)
* Computer’s IP address (a unique number that identifies your computer on the Internet)
* Specific location (geolocation numbers, like from your phone or in tagged photos)
* Credit and debit card numbers, security codes, and expiration dates
* Bank account numbers
* Answers to common security questions
* Name you use day to day, if different from your legal name
* Primary screen name(s)
* Email address (if it’s not public)
* Telephone number
* Race, sexual orientation, and gender
* Mailing address (if it’s different from your residence; otherwise it’s red)
* Country, state, and city of residence
* ZIP code (or postal code)
* Google Voice number
* Secondary screen names or account names (say, a throwaway email that forwards to your primary address)
* Mailing address or PO box
* Digital, online phone number, such as a Skype number
* Email addresses that are not linked to a vital service, such as your bank account
* Photos and videos that don’t embarrass you or reveal private information
* Social media profiles on sites where you’re confident you understand the privacy settings
* General likes, favorites, and things you enjoy sharing on social media sites
* Single-use or gift credit cards
```

</br>

## 4. Communication

> **Make sure you can communicate securely without being surveilled.**

> **You need a way to communicate privately with your peer group and a way to stay up to date.**

### Telegram

Important points:
```
* Telegram group chats are not encrypted.
* Telegram channels are not encrypted.
* Normal chats are not encrypted by default
* The secure chat feature is fishy.
```
> Download [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)

### Wire

```
* End-to-end encrypted : All messaging on Wire uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE), giving users a strong degree of privacy and security.
* Independently audited : Wire is 100% open source with its code available on GitHub, independently audited and ISO, CCPA, GDPR, SOX-compliant.
* Deployment options & device support : Wire can be deployed on Wire's Cloud, your cloud server, or your own on-premises server and all features can be used across web, mobile, and PC.
```
> Download [Wire](https://wire.com/en/download/)

### Signal

Probably one of the most popular, secure private messaging apps that combines:
```
* strong encryption  
* simple UI
* cross-platform
* open-source
* totally free
```
> Download [Signal](https://signal.org/)

### Matrix

Matrix provides:
``` 
* end-to-end-encryption via the Olm and Megolm cryptographic ratchets 
* only the intended recipients can ever decrypt your messages
* while warning if any unexpected devices are added to the conversation
```
> Download [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)

### Session

```
* does not require a mobile number to register
* user is identified by a public key 
* decentralized, with servers being run by the community though Loki Net 
* messages are encrypted and routed through several of these nodes
* all communications are E2E encrypted, and there is no meta data.
```
> Download [Session](https://getsession.org/)

### Silence

If you're restricted to only sending SMS/MMS, then Silence makes it easy to encrypt messages between 2 devices. This is important since traditional text messaging is inherently insecure.
```
* easy-to-use
* reliable
* secure
```
> Download [Silence](https://silence.im/)

### OTR

Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging allows you to have private conversations over instant messaging/ XMPP.
```
* Encryption
* Authentication
* Deniability (After a conversation, it cannot be proved you took part)
* Perfect Forwards Secrecy (if your keys are compromised, no previous messages can be decrypted)
```
> Download [Off-The-Record](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/)

### OpenPGP

Can be used over existing chat networks (such as email or message boards). PGP is used to encrypt messages.
```
* cryptographic privacy
* authentication
```
> Download [OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/)

### Burner

A “burner phone” is a cheap, prepaid mobile phone that you can destroy or discard when you no longer need it. You can read more about it here: <https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/uk/buying-guides/best-burner-phone>

> Here some APP

### Secure email services

ProtonMail is the same company that brought us ProtonVPN. ProtonMail is based in Switzerland, a nonmember of the surveillance alliance Five Eyes, so the company can’t be forced to give the government customer data (doesn't mean it is 100% safe, nothing is). 

Rather, all email has: 
```
* end-to-end encryption 
* open source code
* service is free for Android, iOS, and web users
```
> Download [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail/download)

### Temporary email

Instead of using your private email to register on any services online, use a temporary email.

> Here some sites

* [Temp-mail](https://temp-mail.org/)
* [Tempmail](https://tempail.com/)
* [Tempmailo](https://tempmailo.com/)

</p>

## Social Media

* **Dont share**:

```
Image & video: without removing metadata > https://www.verexif.com/en/
Screenshot of your computer or phone: where we see YOUR actual TIME ZONE
```

* **Dont Enable Auto Login**: If someone gets access to your phone or computer make sure they can’t automatically access your social sites. Make sure your computer’s browser “remember” your login and password isn’t set.

* **Use Two-factor authentication 2FA**: ‘double checking’ you really are who you say you are by texting your phone a code that you need to enter before you can log in.

* **Setup Security Answers**: You can set up security questions on your accounts use questions that are hard to find out about you.

* **Use a VPN**: Virtual Private Network is an encryption tool. If you want to keep your conversations, messages, and calls secure this is the best solution.

* **Keep Antivirus Updated**: Never go on the internet without installing anti-malware and antivirus software to secure your online activity and important data.

* **Change Passwords Frequently**: Always use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols to make it harder to break. Good, secure passwords shouldn’t be easy to remember AND never use the same password for multiple websites because they will all become compromised.

* **Selective Accepting Friends**: Are they really who they say they are? Do you really know that their profile is real and not fake? The safest option is to only accept“friend” requests from people you know in the real world.

* **Turn Off GPS**: Turn off your GPS to keep your exact location private. If you plan to share images online turn off the GPS function to protect your safety.

* **Internet is Permanent**: Always consider that anything you post stays there forever. Even if you delete your account, someone may already print/copy your content.

* **Personal Information**: Careful who you reveal personal information. Always be suspicious of anyone who asks for your personal information over any social media platform.

* **Beware Clicking on Links**: Even if sent from your friends think twice. Hackers love social platforms because you are more likely to click on something from your friends.

* **Block Fake Accounts**: Sadly social media is full of fake profiles. These can be used for a number of reasons from hacking or monitoring your activities

* **Suspicious Login Attempts**: Social media platforms email you if they feel a login is suspicious. Maybe because it comes from a different IP address, a different browser or your account is sending spamming posts. Keep checking your emails regularly. If you get a suspicious login attempt to your account, change your password as soon as possible.

* **Keep Browser Updated**: Make sure you have the latest version of your browser that is not vulnerable to attacks and hackers. Don’t save passwords in your browser because if your system gets compromised your passwords can be easily read.

* **Auto Share Options**: There are options to automatically share posts from one platform to another.

* **Close Old Accounts**: Old social media accounts you haven’t used in years can risk your personal data security. Delete account and remove as much personal information as possible.

* **App Authorisation**: Every time you log in to another site using the option of using a social media login you are granting authorisation to your account. They tell you what data this app will have access to before you agree but if you stop using that site remember to revoke authorisation.

* **Password Manager**: Your passwords are valuable, so treat them that way. There are a number of password manager software available that help you store and organise passwords. This enables you to log in with just one main password that then allows you to access all your accounts. Generate a strong random passwords to make accounts safer.

## Browsing

1. What is the meaning of "Anonymity" online ?

**Your information footprint on the Internet is like your body in the physical world: it represents your identity, (like the location of the device you’re posting from or the pattern of your language) may make it possible for someone to uniquely identify you even when there is no name or other explicit identifier attached.**

**It is virtually impossible to remain anonymous on the Internet. As a consequence of the protocols used for Internet communication, some details of your device’s setup are communicated to your Internet service provider, and often to the site or service you are using.**

2. Most web browsers have **private browsing** modes, but this can be misleading; the sites and services you use can still identify you using;

```
* IP address
* browser configuration
* browsing history (via cookies)
```

*And so ... They can still track your activities on those sites.*

3. Even if you use a tool like an anonymization proxy to cover your 'IP address and the timestamps on your communications', uniquely identifiable information still leaks through;

```
* browser configuration
* cookies
* the infos you supply by a query-by-example request
```

4. Data mining and inference techniques can be used to match anonymized users to their real identities with a high degree of accuracy, including through;

```
* language models
* speaker identification
* facial recognition
* location correlation
* activity modeling
* other retrieval techniques
```

5. It doesn’t always require such specialized techniques; `if there is even a single link between an online identity and your real self`, somebody can submit a query using a single identifier to a commercial data-broker service that aggregates data from many sources, and that service will give them a full personal profile, which can include;

```
* home address
* income level
* job description
* many other private information
```

### Safe browser to use

[Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/)

> Librewolf is an independent “fork” of Firefox, with the primary goals of privacy, security and user freedom. It is the community run successor to LibreFox

[Brave Browser](https://brave.com/)

> Brave Browser, currently one of the most popular private browsers - it provides speed, security, and privacy by blocking trackers with a clean, yet fully-featured UI. It also pays you in BAT tokens for using it. Brave also has Tor built-in, when you open up a private tab/ window.
 
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/)

> Significantly more private, and offers some nifty privacy features than Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari. After installing, there are a couple of small tweaks you will need to make, in order to secure Firefox. For a though config, see @arkenfox's user.js. You can also follow one of these guides by: Restore Privacy or 12Bytes
 
[Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/)

> Tor provides an extra layer of anonymity, by encrypting each of your requests, then routing it through several nodes, making it near-impossible for you to be tracked by your ISP/ provider. It does make every-day browsing a little slower, and some sites may not work correctly. As with everything there are trade-offs
 
## Search engine

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)

> DuckDuckGo is a very user-friendly, fast and secure search engine. It's totally private, with no trackers, cookies or ads. It's also highly customisable, with dark-mode, many languages and features. They even have a .onion URL, for use with Tor and a no Javascript version
 
[Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/)

> French service that aggregates Bings results, with its own results. Quant doesn't plant any cookies, nor have any trackers or third-party advertising. It returns non-biased search results, with no promotions. Quant has a unique, but nice UI.

[Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/)

> All your searches on Startpage are encrypted using HTTPS. The encryption protects you against basic internet snooping. There is no way for someone who's monitoring your connection (for example, on an insecure public Wi-Fi network) to see what you've been searching for or clicking on.

## VPN (Virtual Private Network)

Well I won't give you many choice of VPN, Mullvad is the way to go. If you want to know why, then here a good articles about it: https://www.vpnmentor.com/reviews/mullvad-vpn/

Here I made a guide to install it on Kali Linux:

* [Install Mullvad on Kali](https://github.com/NeverWonderLand/Self-Way/blob/main/Guide/CS_anonymity/install_Mullvad_Kali.md)

</br>

## VM (Virtual Machine)

VMs are isolated from the rest of the system, and multiple VMs can exist on a single piece of hardware, like a server. They can be moved between host servers depending on demand or to use resources more efficiently. VMs allow multiple different operating systems to run simultaneously on a single computer. Each operating system runs in the same way an operating system or application normally would on the host hardware, so the end user experience emulated within the VM is nearly identical to a real-time operating system experience running on a physical machine.

## Encryption

[VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/)

* VeraCrypt is open source cross-platform disk encryption software. You can use it to either encrypt a specific file or directory, or an entire disk or partition. VeraCrypt is incredibly feature-rich, with comprehensive encryption options, yet the GUI makes it easy to use. It has a CLI version, and a portable edition. VeraCrypt is the successor of (the now deprecated) TrueCrypt.

[Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/)

* Open source client-side encryption for cloud files - Cryptomator is geared towards using alongside cloud-backup solutions, and hence preserves individual file structure, so that they can be uploaded. It too is easy to use, but has fewer technical customizations for how the data is encrypted, compared with VeraCrypt. Cryptomator works on Windows, Linux and Mac - but also has excellent mobile apps.

[Age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)

* age is a simple, modern and secure CLI file encryption tool and Go library. It features small explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style composability

[Hat.sh](https://hat.sh/) 

* A Free, Fast, Secure and Serverless File Encryption.

[Stegcloak](https://stegcloak.surge.sh/) 

* Hide secrets with invisible characters in plain text securely using passwords.

[Picocrypt](https://github.com/HACKERALERT/Picocrypt/) 

* A very small (hence "Pico"), very simple, yet very secure file encryption tool.

[Photok](https://github.com/leonlatsch/Photok) 

* Photok is a free Photo-Safe. It stores your photos encrypted on your device and hides them from others.

## Proxy

### HTTP Proxy

This is a server that acts as a middle man between two communications, a client and a server. The proxy sets in the middle and can interact with the request/response cycle.

This component is a good thing for privacy, bypassing filters and any kind of censorship, logging and eavesdropping, and another kind of technical restriction, besides traffic capturing and manipulation.

### Three types of proxy

1. **Forward** : proxies are the ones in which the client sends the request to the proxy and fetch the response on behalf, the client can or not know about the proxy but the server doesn't.

This proxy is placed here: `Client -> Proxy -> Internet <= Server`

2. **Reverse** : this is used behind a network architecture and distributes load traffic to the servers. A request goes directly to the proxy and this one handles the request.

Can be seen like this: `Client -> Internet -> Proxy <= Server`

3. **Transparent** : they do not modify any information without any configuration on the request/response cycle. This is commonly used by ISP providers for faster responses.

Here's how is seen: `Client -> Proxy -> Internet => Server`

### MITMProxy overview

This is an interactive console program that allows traffic flow to be intercepted and more.

Run: `mitmproxy` (this will start a console on the 8080 port) **this can be change**.

Then, go to your browser settings and set the manual proxy settings to your localhost IP and set the same port as the `mitmproxy`

When all the setup is done, you can browse and access any website.

</br>

## VPS

A virtual private server, also known as a VPS, acts as an isolated, virtual environment on a physical server, which is owned and operated by a cloud or web hosting provider. Here some criteria to look for:

* Anonymous registrations
* Offshore jurisdiction
* Offshore server location choices
* Payment anonymity
* Live-chat availability, speed, and quality of help
* Server features Speed, Free migrations, DDoS protection, etc
* Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
* Pricing, obviously
* And refund policies

Some VPS:

* [Bit Launch](https://bitlaunch.io/anonymous-vps/)
* [Cherry Servers](https://www.cherryservers.com/pricing/virtual-servers)
* [Shinjiru](https://www.shinjiru.com/offshore-web-hosting/virtual-private-server/)
* [WebCare 360](https://webcare360.com/offshore-vps-servers.html)
* [Host Winds](https://www.hostwinds.com/vps/unmanaged-linux)
* [Liberty VPS](https://libertyvps.net/)
* [Vsys](https://vsys.host/vps-hosting)
* [VPS Server](https://www.vpsserver.com/bitcoin-vps/)

## Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is an increasingly popular payment method, but contrary to popular belief, it’s not always anonymous. With Bitcoin, for example, all payments are completely transparent. If you want to make anonymous payments, use a cryptocurrency like Monero, which hides the sender, receiver, and amount sent using three different privacy technologies.

Sonme tips:

* Use Two-Factor Authentication for Your Exchange
* Use an Authenticator app
* Withdraw Your Crypto
* Back Up Your Seed Words Properly
* Use a Strong Password to Protect Your Crypto
* Use a Different Password for Your Wallet
* Use a Hardware Wallet If Possible
* Check the URL (Avoid Fake Software)
* Fake Web Apps:
  * Use only Dapps you trust 
  * Make sure you use only the official website for an app
  * Check the lock icon to the left of the URL
  * Double check contract addresses
* Don’t Enter Your Seed Words on a Website
* Avoid Public Wi-Fi
* Subscribe to a VPN Service
* Be Wary of Emailed Files

</br>

## Whistleblowing

**Best Digital Practices for Whistleblowing**

1. Dont use your work phones
   * To protect your anonymity, use your home phone as opposed to the phone in your office or organization.

2. Don’t work on your home or work Internet
   * If you’re using your home device on a public Wi-Fi network like at a coffee shop, use a VPN, or Virtual Private Network. VPNs hide your web traffic and IP address, encrypting your activity.

3. Create accounts with fake names
   * For any email, social media or messaging apps you may be using to communicate about your whistleblowing, create new accounts with fake information.

4. Stay on task
   * When you’re working on your whistleblowing by using the Internet at all, make sure you don’t do other online activities simultaneously, like checking your email or shopping online.

5. Use a secure browser
   * We recommend using Tor instead of your regular web browser, as it lets users remain anonymous.

6. Use encrypted messaging apps
   * Instead of using your phone’s default messaging app like iMessage, use an encrypted app like TextSecure

7. Check phone settings
   * You may not know this, but your phone is most likely tracking you at all times.

8. Here’s how to change your settings:
   * iOS: Under Settings, click on Bluetooth and toggle the switch off. Next under Settings, go to Privacy then Location Services and toggle the switch to off.
   * Android: In Settings, click Connected Devices, Connection Preferences, then Bluetooth and turn it off. Also in Settings click on Google, Manage Your Google Account, Data and Personalization then Activity Controls and turn it off.

9. Hide your screen
   * Hacking isn’t the only way that people can get your credentials; they can also do it the old-fashioned way by peaking over your screen15. To hide your web activity in a flash, you’ll need to know the device’s keyboard shortcut you can press to hide your web windows or tabs.

10. Here are the shortcuts for the most popular computer brands:
```
Mac: Command-H
Windows: Windows + D
Chromebook: Shift + Ctrl + w
Dell: Alt + Q
HP: Alt + F4
Lenovo: Ctrl-W
```

11. Close accounts on public computers
    * If you’re using a public computer, make sure to completely log out of your accounts and remove any devices or software that you used on it.
