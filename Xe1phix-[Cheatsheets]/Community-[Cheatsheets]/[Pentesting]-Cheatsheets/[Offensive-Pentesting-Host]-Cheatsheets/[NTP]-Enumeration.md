# NTP ENUM - port 123

NTP stands for Network Time Protocol 

The current version of NTP is ntpv4 and uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and port number 123

IT Desing for synchronize clocks of networked computers.

### Attacker queries NTP server to gather valuable information such as:
• List of hosts connected to NTP server

• Clients IP addresses in a network, their system names and OS

• Internal IPs can also be obtained if NTP server is in the DMZ


# NTP Enumeration by using NMAP tool 

### NTP Port scan 
```
nmap -v -p 123 -sU -Pn <IP>
```
PORT    STATE         SERVICE

123/udp open ntp

### NTP predefine scripts
```
ls -lh /usr/shares/nmap/scripts | grep ntp
```
ntp-info.nse

ntp-monlist.nse

### NTP Version detection 
```
nmap -v -sV -p 123 -sU -Pn  <IP>
```

PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION

123/udp open  ntp     NTP v4 (secondary server)

# NTP Enumeration Commands

## ntptrace
The ntptrace works like traceroute, reporting the links in the chain to the local NTP server

• Traces a chain of NTP servers back to the primary source
```
ntptrace [-vdn] [-r retries] [-t timeout] [server]
```
 -n, --numeric                Print IP addresses instead of hostnames
 
 -m, --max-hosts=num          Maximum number of peers to trace
 
 -r, --host=str               Single remote host
 
  -?, --help                   Display usage information and exit
  
--more-help              Pass the extended usage text through a pager

## ntpdc

• Monitors operation of the NTP daemon, ntpd
``` 
/usr/bin/ntpdc [-n] [-v] host1 | IPaddress1…
```
```
ntpdc -c monlist <IP_ADDRESS>
```
```
ntpdc -c listpeers <IP_ADDRESS>
```
```
ntpdc -c sysinfo <IP_ADDRESS>
```
## ntpq
The ntpq  is for diagnostic and information gathering on a specific NTP server. It has an interface similar to that of ftp and smb

• Monitors NTP daemon ntpd operations and determines performance
```
ntpq [-inp] [-c command] [host] […]
```
READLIST
Displays the names and values of the peer variables of the server with the given association by sending a read status request.
```
ntpq -c readlist <IP_ADDRESS>
```
READVAR
Displays the values of the specified peer variables of the server with the given association by sending a read variables request.
```
ntpq -c readvar <IP_ADDRESS>
```
PEERS
An old form of the peers subcommand. Replaces the reference ID with the local interface address.
```
ntpq -c peers <IP_ADDRESS>
```
ASSOCIATION
Obtains and prints a list of association identifiers and peer statuses for in-spec peers of the server being queried.

The data returned by the associations subcommand is cached internally in the ntpq query program.
```
ntpq -c associations <IP_ADDRESS>
```
