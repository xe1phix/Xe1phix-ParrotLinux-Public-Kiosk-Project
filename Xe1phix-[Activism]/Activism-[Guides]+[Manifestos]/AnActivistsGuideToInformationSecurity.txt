Introduction 

Technological progress has made it next to impossible to defend against a 
sufficiently powerful attacker (see this 1 for a scary example). Fortunately, most 
of us don’t have the NSA hard on our heals, and local authorities are usually 
limited in their possibilities. The trick is to be sufficiently careful while staying 
functional. 

This guide tries to point out the possibilities and their trade-offs. It is split into 
the following sections: 

• Security Culture introduces the social side of things 

• Physical security describes securing physical access to information 

• Traditional communication is about the pre-Internet kind 

• Digital base security discusses building a digital base to communicate 
from 

• Internet services points out problems with and alternatives to 
common Internet communications services 

Security Culture 

• The need to know principle: share information only with those who 
need it. 

• Establish a culture where people realize when not to ask curious 
questions and don’t take offense when information is not shared with 
them. 

• It is not necessary to know who is in which group and participated in 
which action - don’t brag about it and stop others if they do. You can’t 
accidentally reveal something you don’t know. 


3 



• Do not keep unnecessary information (e.g. meeting minutes) and keep 
your house clean of incriminating material (also: do not make pictures 
on action, not even pixelated ones 2 ). 

• Do not connect pseudonyms with their public information (e.g., if 
possible, do not store people’s activist email addresses with their name 
or group). 

• Don’t let paranoia paralyze you: try to keep a realistic assessment 
of the threat model and don’t suspect people to be snitches just because 
they don’t conform to subcultural stereotypes. 


Physical Security 

While few of our homes can successfully resist a police raid, measures can be 
taken to fend off fascist thugs or rouge state agents. 

Obscurity: It can be useful to live at a place not registered as your official address, 
and without obvious subcultural symbols on the outside. Still, be prepared for 
sufficiently motivated forces of darkness to find and attack your home. 

Passive defense: Protecting a home from the evils on the outside necessarily 
means forming an in-group. A reasonable front door and handpicked distribution 
of keys go a long way. Barred ground level and basement windows and anti- 
splinter films on the glass offer additional reinforcement. 

Active defense: An alarm horn and a lighting system on the outside may mainly 
help against physical attacks, but they can also buy valuable time in case of a 
police raid. 

Process: Have a short guide on dealing with police raids and your lawyers’ 
(mobile) numbers on the inside of the front door and next to the landline phone. 

In some jurisdictions, having people’s private rooms marked with their name 
may help to argue against a search when it is only against one person. However, it 
obviously also reveals the inhabitants’ names to visitors and does only point out 
the existing legal situation to police who often ignore it anyway.

Traditional Communication 

With a reasonably safe home, let’s relax and see what our comrades were up to, 
shall we? 

Face to Face Communication 

Modern technology enables the surveillance of the spoken word from far away 
and even microphone-unfriendly places such as swimming pools and concert 
halls can theoretically be surveyed with modern noise-canceling technology. 
However, taking a walk is still a fairly secure way of communication, when it is 
reasonably unlikely that hidden microphones are placed in clothes and accessories 
(that means no mobile phones, too!). If more security is needed, one can resort to 
writing on paper in a sight-protected place (e.g. under a blanket). 

Closed rooms can be monitored even more easily, thus sensitive meetings in 
established autonomous centers, alternative house projects, lefty bars and the like 
are strongly discouraged! 

Letters 

Hopefully you already figured that relying on the confidentiality of snail mail is 
a gamble at best. Code words are a last refuge for the imprisoned and desperate, 
but history has shown that relying on a secret method (e.g. swapping letters) 
alone to hide information is easily broken. 

(Mobile) Phones 

Most importantly, all information (calls, texts, mobile Internet) exchanged via 
the (mobile) phone network should be considered captured by state agencies and 
potentially other enemies. They use ETS1 wiretapping interfaces mandatory in 
all mobile network equipment sold in the EU (and thus available everywhere) 
(source 3 ), but on top of that, other motivated actors can capture data in a local cell 
with a few hundred Euros worth of equipment (source 4 ). 

Phones Themselves are Identifiable! 

The second most important thing to know is that mobile phones have a unique 
1ME1 number, that identifies it in the mobile network. Normally the information 
about your 1ME1 is registered in operator network together with SIM card, that 
means when you put a new SIM card into your old phone, it can be easily linked 
to your old SIM card. So for a safe phone, both SIM cards and phones need to be 
acquired and swapped in a way that does not link them to any other information, 
i.e. by buying phones with cash and getting pre-registered SIM cards or registering

them anonymously in the network, for example via TOR (see below). 


have meetings in inconspicuous locations without mobile phones 


Location Tracking 

To work, mobile phones regularly contact the base station they are booked into, 
which locates the phone within a minimum of about 400m from the cell tower 
in urban areas (source 5 ). This information is routinely stored by mobile carriers 
and therefore available without prior targeted surveillance (source 6 ). For users 
of centralized location services (like Google Maps), the police may be able to 
obtain extremely accurate long time location profiles from the provider (' source 7 '). 

With targeted surveillance, triangulation and querying data from the phone 
can locate it down to 50m (source 8 ), or even 5m with a GPS-equipped phone 
(source 7 ). To get a more time-accurate location profile, state agencies may use so- 
called stealth pings / silent SMS to make a mobile phone contact its base station 
more often ( source 9 !. 

As a last resort, police can use so-called IMSI-catchers which pretend to be the 
strongest network cell available, and then record what phones book into them, 
potentially even recording calls and text messages (source 10 , some real-world 
examples 11 ! . 

Police have been known to use geodata on all kinds of incidents and extended 
cell phone surveillance of 10s of people on the most ridiculous accusations, or 
even deploying IMSI-catchers on sit-ins against fascist marches, so the technical 
possibilities are not to be taken lightly. 

Room Surveillance / “Silent Calls” 

Much controversy exists as to whether it is possible to tap mobile microphones 
even when no calls are going on. This 12 article hints the FBI has done it, while 
this 13 research hints it would be built-in functionality. Our guess is that this at 
maximum used against high profile targets, because if any hicksville cop shop 
was able to use that, the evidence of it would be better known by now. Besides 
sneaky network attacks, smartphones have been surveyed by malicious apps 
(source 14 !. 

Open source mobile OSes (like Replicant 15 for Android devices) offer no 
protection against those attacks, because there is usually a direct connection from 
the microphone to the (always closed source, as to comply with regulations) 
baseband firmware and it can not reliably be powered off. To make matters worse, 
mobile phones without SIM card might still pre-register to the strongest network 
(for emergency services), and there is no way to check if “offline/airplane mode” 
is actually what it promises to be. 

To err on the side of caution, it is advisable to leave your phone at home when 


• put Linux on your computer and encrypt your data, learn to use PGP 
for inter-group email and build a network of Jabber contacts with verified 
OTR encryption for ad hoc chats 

• learn to use TOR safely 

• share skills, teach each other and don’t panic 


Endnotes 

A) Technical background: most Intel-based computers run a software that 
can control the system remotely in parallel to the normal Operating System 
(AMT 69 ), which can be “disabled” in the manufacturer’s firmware but that is 
closed source, and modern Intel Processors only boot with signed firmware 
(Intel Boot Guard 70 ), so you will never be able to use alternative firmware like 
Libreboot 71 , and even if you could, there would still be things in your computer 
that you do not have the source code for 72 . 

B) This security analysis 74 illustrates quite well that even without any 
malicious intend, mobile devices as commonly used are just not very secure. 

C) The only way to prevent this to sign the unencrypted data and let some 
trusted part check the signature. This can either be done using a TPM, or more 
readily by using SecureBoot and trusting your manufacturer’s firmware (which 
is what modern Linux distributions do). Some pointers: l 75 , 2 76

exists as a pretty okay encryption method. However, some caveats apply: 

1. The fact that two people are communicating is not concealed, 
therefore use pseudonyms not linked to other activities. 

2. OTR commonly uses an authentication system based on things only 
the other person knows, ft is important to make use of it to be sure you’re 
actually talking to the right person. Otherwise if the dark side manages to 
intimidate your Jabber provider they could pose as your friend/comrade. 

3. Files sent via Jabber are not encrypted with OTR. 

4. Audio and video chats in Jabber clients are not encrypted by default. 

einfachJabber.de 59 has an elaborate German introduction and guides for all kinds 
of devices and operating systems. English language tutorials can be found at the 
EFF’s Surveillance Self-Defence guide ( Linux 60 . Mac OS 38 . Windows 37 !. 

Voice / Videochat 

There are several solutions that are Open Source software, available for multiple 
computing platforms and offer end to end encryption of audio and video 
( overview 61 ! . If you can live with the disadvantages, Signal 50 seems to be the 
most practical solution for mobile platforms. 

On laptop/desktop computers, if you can get it to work, Tox 62 is a pretty amazing, 
high security and low effort alternative. More traditionally, Jitsi 63 enables 
encrypted calls via either a SIP or better yet, a Jabber/XMPP (see above) account. 
Ring 64 seems to be another promising alternative (that we haven’t tried yet), and 
Wire 65 , while also centralized, seems to offer an alternative to Signal that does not 
need phone numbers or Google services and makes some bold privacy claims 66 . 

A more ad-hoc method involves a technology called WebRTC just requires a 
modern web browser like Firefox or Chrome, with the caveat of trusting some 
central web site to not be malicious (and the connection to that network not to 
be manipulated). pavala.tv 67 and meet.jit.si 68 are two open source based web 
services for that. 

Wrapping it up 

If this has gotten your head spinning, here is the bottom line. 

TL;DR: 

• do actions with people you trust, be honest with them but don’t gossip 
and brag and don’t keep more information than necessary 

• separate your activist and your bourgeois life’s Internet identities as 
much as possible 


visiting a sensitive meeting, or at least take out your phone’s battery a good 
couple of km from the meeting point, because the attendants, (cell tower) 
location, time and duration of a sensitive meeting can easily be spotted by 30 
people switching off their phones simultaneously. Especially when meeting with 
small groups in densely populated areas, it might be as good to simply put the 
powered on mobiles in a location outside hearing distance (the fridge two rooms 
away, for instance). 

ft should be noted that mobile phones transmit power status (idle, running) during 
operation and send goodbye messages to the network when powered off properly 
(so that creates a different pattern than just ripping out the battery). 


Digital Base Security 

Traditional means of communication don’t feel so good anymore, so what about 
the Internet? First we need to find a secure device that we can use it with. When it 
is about information, security is classically divided into integrity, confidentiality 
and availability. Let’s see what they mean. 

Chose your Computing Device (integrity) 

None of today’s common devices are completely under your control. Laptops and 
desktop computers come with obscure low level software (“firmware") that is 
controlled by the manufacturer. (A) 

The same is true for tablets; and smartphones are even worse, because they 
are always also controlled from the mobile network ( source 13 !. On top of that, 
smartphones are complex computers which often are not treated to security 
updates by their manufacturers, making them an easy target for attacks ( source 17 !. 
Moreover, they are designed to collect crazy amounts of information on people 
by default - information that is more often than not readily available to state 
agencies with or without request. 

Therefore the use of smartphones for activist work is strongly discouraged, 

as even the security of alternative Internet services like Jabber/XMPP is greatly 
diminished on the vast majority of mobile devices. 

But don’t despair, running as much Free and Open Source Software as possible on 
your computer gives you a good deal of control back. With proprietary software 
like Microsoft Windows or Apple’s Mac OS, chances are they will support law 
enforcement in their effort to “fight crime” and break into your computer. With

Linux or any other open alternative, the program code is exposed to a whole 
community, making it much harder to mess with. 

There are many different bundles of the Linux core with various open source 
software called distributions, of which we recommend two specifically: 

• Linux Mint 18 offers one of the most painless ways to get an open 
system with many probably familiar software like Firefox, VLC player, 
LibreOffice etc. They offer different Editions of which XFCE is a simple, 
fast desktop that still runs well on old computers and Cinnamon is a bit 
more fancy. 

• Ubuntu Linux 19 is the base for Linux Mint and a company effort to 
build a user friendly version of Linux. It is itself based on one of the 
oldest community distributions, Debian 20 . While the company behind it 
decides its direction, it still has a very strong community around it. 

• Installation: Make sure to save all your important data on some 
external medium (hard drive or stick) and get support from a computer 
geek if you can. It is usually possible to install Linux next to Windows, 
but expect the installation to overwrite everything. To get you started 
here is a guide to install Ubuntu from a USB drive 21 that should also 
work with Linux Mint if you just download their files, and here is a video 
how to to install Linux Mint 22 But first read the next paragraph. . . 

Storage Encryption (confidentiality) 

Encrypt your computer! All further advices for software and communication 
means are not safe if your computer is not safe. 

The encryption is intended against offline attacks only, if the police captures 
your computer unlocked, they will just copy your data. A screen lock or 
suspend mode with a decent password is better than nothing, but the device 
should be powered down whenever possible. 

So if the police knocks your door, first run to your computer and press the 
power button until it switches off. 

There are three major ways to encrypt your data: 

Encrypt your Home Folder 

Use this if unsure: only your personal data gets encrypted (including Firefox 
Bookmarks etc.), but the rest is not. 


In order to figure out who of your contacts uses the same application, the apps 
generally require uploading information on all of them to their servers ( source 47 ), 
but they do so in various degrees from grabbing the whole address book to just 
uploading an obscured form of the phone numbers. The privacy implications 
of this for activist are huge, because one person uploading an anonymous 
number with the person’s real name will ruin their effort. 

WHATS APP is by far the most successful mobile messenger to date, and recently 
they too claim to support “end to end” encryption (everything is encrypted 
between you and the people you talk to). However, because the source code to 
their programs is not open, there is no way to check if there is a secret master 
key for law enforcement. Even if there is not, they can still disclose who you are 
communicating with and when. 

Basically the same holds for THREEMA, as their software is not Open Source 
either. 

TELEGRAM has convinced many boasting with their altruism. They do provide 
the source code of their client, but their encryption is outdated techniques from 
the 70ies (source 48 ), needs to be enabled manually and does not work for group 
chats. On the other hand, they do go all inclusive when they just grab your address 
book, unlike others not just number but with names (source 49 ). 

Now, SIGNAL 50 . They are a lot more privacy minded than the rest of the phone 
number based messenger crowd. Whilst they still technically get to see all the 
patterns of communication (but not the content) ( source 51 !, at least their founder 
comes from a more trustworthy background (source 52 : and he has some pretty 
funny stories 53 , too). Still, the system is centralized and while the clients are Open 
Source, they maintain tight control over their network. Signal is only available 
on Android with Google Services / Google Play and iOS and Signal’s inventor 
actively asks alternative software to leave the network (source 54 ). People find 
elaborate ways to get around the need for a phone number (guide 55 ) and make 
Signal work without Google Services (l 56 , 2 57 , 3 58 ). Altogether this makes Signal 
a good choice for people who use Google-enabled Android or Apple smartphones 
anyway, but better tools exist for people who need more security than mobile 
platforms provide. 

Jabber /XMPP 

Enter Jabber / XMPP. Finally, you made it! This is what we currently 
recommend for sensitive real-time communication. 

Similarly to email, people from many different service providers (see the 
alternative tech collectives above) can talk to each other. Also similarly to email, 
per default Jabber offers only very weak encryption. For actual messages, OTR 


13 



Email 


Email is like postcards, assume it is read by transport providers and state agencies. 
PGP is a way to encrypt (wrap your postcard) email contents, but be aware that 
the email subject and the fact who is communicating when, with whom and from 
which computer, are not concealed. 

Immerda.ch has is a nice German introduction into how PGP works here 39 . 
PGP depends on keys (special files that are protected with a password) that, like 
physical keys, should restrict access to information. Therefore PGP’s security 
depends on a safe key exchange; so make sure you got the right key, e.g. by 
getting it in person from the recipient. 

The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Surveillance Self-Defence guide has a 
pretty good howto for using PGP (Linux 40 , Windows 41 , Mac OS X 42 ). 

Mailing Lists 

Now if PGP encrypts messages between two people, what about mailing 
lists? If there is just a small group, people can exchange PGP public keys and 
then everybody can encrypt their message so that every recipient can read it. 
Unfortunately, this gets messy quickly if new people join the list. Therefore, 
people came up with a solution that is not as secure, but better than nothing: 

Schleuder 43 is a mailing list software that gets its own PGP pair. Everybody 
then encrypts email to Schleuder ’s mailing list key and Schleuder decrypts the 
message, and encrypts and sends it to each list member separately. Of course the 
downside is that whoever is running Schleuder could get hold of Schleuder’s 
PGP private key and read the encrypted messages. Yet, as Schleuder is a complex 
beast, it is recommended to use it from a tech collective you trust, like for example 
Immerda.ch 44 . 

Messengers / Chat 

TL;DR: don’t use the rest and skip down to Jabber below 

SKYPE has a reputation for being encrypted, however they have publicly stated 
their ability and willingness to hand out information to law enforcement, which 
they do in required cases. All your written text are stored on the servers of Skype 
and can be accessed by police (source 45 ). 

For quite awhile, mobile messenger apps based on phone numbers have been 
gaining popularity. If you consider using any “secure” messenger on a mobile 
device, be reminded 46 that communication through the mobile network is 
vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation. 


Advantages: 

• The computer pretty much works as normal and your personal files 
are still very safe. 

Disadvantages: 

• You should use a long user password, which you will need to type 
each time the screen is locked 

• It is possible to manipulate your programs (e.g. Firefox, GPG) so they 
reveal your passwords etc. 

• How to: during Linux installation, select “Encrypt my home folder” 
when creating your user 

Encrypt the Whole System 

This means that only a tiny part of your hard drive remains unencrypted and 
everything else - your programs, etc. - is. 

Advantages: 

• It makes it harder e.g. to put a bad version of Firefox or GPG on your 
computer 

• You can use one long strong password just for starting the computer 
and a shorter for your screen lock 

Disadvantages: 

• You need to start the computer, put in the password and then wait for 
it to come up 

• You need to remember two passwords, and the disk encryption 
password is harder to change 

• How to: during Linux installation, at Installation type select “Encrypt 
the new (Linux Mint/Ubuntu) installation for security” 

Use an Encrypted Container 

An external drive or a very big file (“container”) is encrypted and you need to 
unlock / put files in and out / lock the encryption separately 


12

Advantages: 

• Can be used to transfer files between encrypted computers 

• Can be used on external hard drives 

• Can be used on Windows and Mac OS 

• Can be used as additional secure place that is normally closed on an 
already encrypted Linux 

• Has special features to so that a fake password can show fake files, if 
you are forced to give a password 

Disadvantages: 

• All kinds of temporary files from LibreOffice, Thunderbird email, 
Firefox surfing profiles etc. are not encrypted 

• Needs to be opened and closed separately

Android and iOS 

While mobile platforms are still not recommended for sensitive data (B), some 
protection is better than none, and turning on encryption for your personal data 
will at slow down the cops (but remember FBI vs. Apple 28 and especially their 
general cooperation).

Limitations 

Your password prompt must come from somewhere and so there’s always 
unencrypted data on your device, data that can be messed with (e.g. replacing 
your Linux’ password prompt with one that sends the password to the police). 
This can be made harder with some tricks (C), but remember that the most 
realistic scenario is a simple police raid. 

Backup your Data (availability) 

If it comes to a police raid (or a simple break-in), an oh-so-amazingly encrypted 
device will still be taken by the police. To take some of the pressure off yourself, 
regularly stash encrypted copies of your data outside your home, ideally with 
people that are not relatives nor active in the same groups. 

While we are at it, even public data should not be trusted to IT corporations, as 
they might just delete 31 or accidentally lose it.

Internet Services 

So by now we can use a well-secured Laptop behind our locked door to write 
lengthy security guides, but how do we actually talk to people in a secure way? 

Besides the technical aspects below, using alternative service providers offers an 
additional degree of protection, such as storing data encrypted and refusing to 
cooperate with the police. A list of alternative tech collectives can be found here 32 
and even more here 33 . 


A word about Web Browsers 

Web browsers like Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome are complex monsters 
and a lot of web sites out there track their visitors. The Riseup Collective has a 
compact guide 34 how to use a browser more securely. 

Anonymity 

The whole point of the Internet is to connect two computers, like yours with... 
say Youtube. Now for the cat videos to find their way back to you, obviously 
the computers on the way ( routers ) need to know the Internet address of your 
connection. The trouble is that if any computer on the way is surveyed by the 
state or you access an evil web site like e.g. that of the police, they could track 
that Internet address back to your physical place, or connect it with other online 
activity you were doing (like accessing your web mail). There are two ways to 
avoid this, which for additional security should ideally be combined with each 
other: 

The first is simply to use public wifi in places where there are no surveillance 
cameras. Unfortunately, your computer’s wifi has a unique MAC address. It can 
be changed with software in case the wifi stores them (some corporate portals 
will, to tell if you already acknowledge the Terms of Service, or used up your 
hour of free Internet), but for a start just also use method number two: 

The second method is to use a software called TOR 35 , or The Onion Router. In 
a nutshell, it works by sending your data in 3 layers of encryption (hence the 
“onion”) over three computers ( TOR nodes), where the first knows your Internet 
address and the second node to contact (but not the destination), the second 
knows nothing (only which the third node will be), and the third node knows the 
destination, but not the origin. There are some subtleties to use it securely so best 
follow the guides (Linux 36 . Windows 37 . Mac OS X 38 ! and strictly only use the 
TOR Browser when doing anything sensitive.
