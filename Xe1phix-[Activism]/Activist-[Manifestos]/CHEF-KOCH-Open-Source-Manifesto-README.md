# Open Source Manifesto <sup>1</sup>

* **The program MUST include source code** - The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form.
* **MUST be a [reproducible build](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2019-08/msg00186.html)** - Which means<sub>2</sub> I can verify that the pre-built binary is the same as the source code.
* **MUST be formally verified** - This means I know the code is written with correctness.
* **MUST be FOSS** - I can audit and verify that the program is what it claims to be.
* **MUST be signed with PGP and or signify signatures** - So I know the source code came from an authorized developer or organization.
* **MUST have a small code base** - Less code is easier auditable and is more attractive to new maintainers.
* **MUST NOT support Funding/Donations** - This should be optional.
* **MUST provide a proper download platform** - E.g. via decentralized storage platform, so that the software can never be censored by a single party or organization.
* **MUST utilizes peer reviewed and approved implementations of client side encryption on all remote storage software** - I 100% know that files can't be accessed by my storage provider or anyone who hacks my service or storage provider.
* **MUST utilizes peer reviewed and approved implementations of end-to-end encryption for all communication to/from the software** - Which means I know that my information is not intercepted in transit and read or modified.
* **Should formally audited** - That indicates that I know the code has been thoroughly checked by professionals, making it less likely to still have flaws.
* **Derived works** - The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.
* **No Discrimination Against Persons or specific Groups** - The license nor the source code itself should NOT discriminate specific persons or entire group of persons.
* **Technology neutral** - Basically the freedom of individuals and organizations to choose the most appropriate technology adequate to their needs and requirements for development.
* **IS NOT proprietary software** - Programs that are exclusive property of their developers or publishers, and cannot be copied or distributed without complying with their licensing agreements should NOT be included.



1. Open source as it [should](https://opensource.org/osd) be!
2. Most open source repostirories having a [reproducible build problem](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2019-08/msg00186.html).
