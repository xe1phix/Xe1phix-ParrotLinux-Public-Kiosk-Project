Sobriety and 
Anarchist 
Struggle 



2 



This edition of "Towards a Less Fucked Up World: 
Sobriety and Anarchist Struggle" by Nick Riotfag was 
reprinted in 2014 by Sprout Distro. 

We have been tabling with an older version of this zine 
for years, but were unable to find a copy of the revised 
edition of the zine. This edition features the revised 
text along with an afterward that appeared in the 
book, Sober Living for the Revolution'- Hardcore Punk, 
Straight Edge, and Radical Politics. 

While we didn't write this zine, we find great affinity 

with the arguments presented within. Hopefully 
making this revised text more widely available will 
continue to spur more conversations about sobriety and 
anarchist struggle.

Introduction 



This zine is an ongoing project I've been writing in my head and on 
paper for several years now. Since I decided to become permanently 
sober several years ago, I've constantly struggled to find safe spaces; I 
hoped that when I started to become a part of radical, activist, and 
anarchist communities, that I would find folks who shared or at least 
respected my convictions. Instead, I found a painful paradox: radical 
scenes that were so welcoming and affirming in many ways, yet 
incredibly inflexible and unsupportive around my desire to be in sober 
spaces. 

I have plenty of reasons for being substance free that aren't "political," 
per se. Some are more personal or internal: I love my body and want to 
preserve my health; I'm personally terrified of addiction; I tend towards 
extremes, so I think that if I did drink or drug I'd overdo it; my family 
has had alcoholics and drug abusers who have ruined lives. Others are 
more pragmatic: as an activist I participate in actions that could put me 
at risk for arrest, and the legal risks of drug possession just aren't 
worthwhile; I have better things to spend money on; and so forth. 
However, my primary reasons for choosing this lifestyle are specifically 
connected to my political beliefs as a revolutionary, a feminist, and an 
anarchist. I don't think that most folks with whom I work on political 
projects realize or acknowledge that my choice to be sober isn't just a 
personal preference or an annoying puritan dogma. This zine is my 
attempt to articulate why I consider sobriety a crucial part of my 
anarchism and feminism. 

I've tried to put it together in a way that combines theory and analysis 
with my personal experience. The first few sections explore the 
connections I see between intoxication and different kinds of oppression 
(sorry if it gets a little wordy at times); the next bit talks about how 
intoxication fits into radical communities; then I offer two stories from 
my life and my reflections on them before the conclusions. 

I realize that sober folks have traditionally not been known for 
presenting our views respectfully, with open ears and loving hearts. I'm 
definitely among those who stand guilty of bludgeoning people with my 
beliefs. Hopefully this zine will at least in part rectify that tendency by 
explaining my views without judging or blaming non-sober folks or 
4 



seeming to set myself up as superior to others. If it fails in this, I 
apologize in advance, and welcome folks to call me out on it. That said, 
please know that much of my anger that manifests in a "judgmental" or 
"preachy" tone comes from constant denial of safe space, refusal to 
recognize the legitimacy of our feelings and opinions, alienation in most 
social environments, and general ignoring of our concerns and desires 
and needs. I write with love and rage, and I apologize for neither. 

A Quick Note on Words 

I like the term "straightedge," not because I'm especially invested in the 
bands and the scene, but rather because I like the way it places my 
decision not to drink or take drugs in the larger context of a positive 
radical social critique. Of course, I've found that most folks — probably 
many of y'all, too — have nothing but negative associations with sXe : 
macho white dudes beating up people, crappy music, super dogmatic 
and preachy assholes, or even anti-abortion extremists. Even though I 
completely reject all of those things, I still think there's hope for 
reclaiming the term as something positive. But because for most folks 
I've asked it's often more of a stumbling block than a help, I'm going to 
stick with "sober" or "substance-free" for the purposes of this zine. 

Here are some definitions for some of the key concepts I'll be talking 
about: 

• Intoxication: an artificially altered state of mind produced through 
drug and alcohol consumption 

• Intoxication Culture: a set of institutions, behaviors, and mindsets 
centered around consumption of drugs and alcohol 

• Patriarchal Masculinity: a way of behaving and understanding 
oneself as a man based on fucked up sexist values 

• Anesthesia: artificially-induced numbness to sensations and 
feelings 

Masculinity, Rape Culture, and Intoxication 

Dear readers^ please know that this section includes discussion of 
sexual violence and other things that may be difficult or triggering to 
some folks. Please use self-care to determine if and when it makes

sense to read this. Thanks! 



I saw a billboard once as I was riding my bike through downtown New 
Orleans. It was advertising some kind of fancy liquor, whiskey I think. 
The slogan was, "It's what men do." The message was almost 
reassuring to me; the only possible conclusion, I supposed, is that I 
must not be a man. The mass media encourages folks socialized as men 
to affirm our masculinity through intoxication, specifically through 
capitalist alcohol consumption. The whiskey billboard I saw, along with 
Budweiser ads that show "male bonding," various beer companies 
whose commercials use men objectifying women, and countless other 
advertisements, show alcohol as the common theme that links men as 
they engage in the most manly of activities. How surprising is it, then, 
that alcohol is almost always involved in some of the "manliest" 
pursuits of all — male violence against women, including domestic 
violence, sexual assault, and rape? 

The relationship between intoxication, gender, and violence is complex. 
A significant proportion of gendered violence — specifically sexual and 
relationship violence against women — is committed by men while 
intoxicated. Of course, this doesn't mean that intoxication causes 
violence, but it would be equally foolish to ignore the correlation. In 
heterosexual interactions, men who have learned from media and pop 
culture to understand themselves as initiators and seducers use alcohol 
as a tool for overcoming resistance both from the desired sexual 
conquest and from their own conscience. At the same time, in this 
harshly puritanical, sex-negative culture, many rely on alcohol as their 
only means of overcoming the shame they feel about our sexual desires. 
Generally speaking, I think that the broad dependence in this society 
on alcohol in the process of finding partners and having sex obscures 
our sexuality, negatively impacts communication, reduces our ability to 
give and receive meaningful consent, lessens the probability of safe sex 
practices, and supports rape culture. When this dependence, and all of 
the dangers it entails, connects with patriarchal notions of sexuality, 
including male senses of entitlement, the hunter/hunted dynamic, and 
"no means yes" myths, the result can be disastrous. 

As a man, part of my decision to live a sXe or sober lifestyle stems from 
my recognition that patriarchy and intoxication culture go hand in 
hand. Intoxication is used as an excuse to justify (and legally, a 

6 



mitigating factor in the prosecution of) a wide range of unacceptable 
behaviors, including sexual harassment and rape. In my personal 
experience, many people I've known — most often men — have 
significantly altered their behavior while intoxicated in ways that 
directly reinforce oppression (i.e. becoming more openly homophobic 
and misogynist in speech, more sexually aggressive, etc), and expected 
the fact that they were intoxicated to somehow alleviate their 
responsibility for these behaviors. The idea that being intoxicated 
somehow makes one less able to make rational and compassionate 
decisions should be a reason to abstain from using alcohol and drugs. 

In saying this, I want to make clear that I do not intend to blame 
victims; there is absolutely no excuse for sexual or relationship 
violence, regardless of the intoxication or not of the assaulter or the 
survivor. I refuse to allow one's intoxication to reduce one's culpability 
for fucked up behavior. If there's any possibility that drinking or taking 
drugs could increase, even the slightest bit, one's capacity to be violent 
or abusive, then I consider that more than enough reason to be 
substance-free. If you're making the decision to get intoxicated or 
fucked up, and you care about living your ideals in any meaningful 
way, you need a plan for how you can be held accountable, by yourself 
and others, for how you behave when you choose to do so, in sexual 
situations and beyond. 

I want to emphasize that this is not something that exists only in the 
"mainstream," as if anarchist or radical communities were immune 
from its effects. Women in our communities are speaking out about 
sexual harassment and assault and rape at the hands of "radical" men. 
In virtually every case of which I'm aware, alcohol played a major part 
in these incidents. One of my dearest friends has been sexually 
harassed on multiple occasions and sexually assaulted by intoxicated 
anarchist men, who, while sober, expressed serious and firm anti- 
patriarchy convictions. Yes, anarchist men, feminist men, men who say 
they are fighting patriarchy with all their might, that means us; if we 
take seriously the charge to be responsible, anti-sexist allies to women, 
I strongly believe that we must look very critically at the ways we get 
intoxicated. 1 

This pattern of boundary-crossing while intoxicated doesn't always fall 
predictably along gender lines. Sometimes women take advantage of

men sexually using intoxication; at times the intoxication of both or all 
parties makes it difficult to sort out accountability; sometimes 
participants don't neatly fit gender boxes and power dynamics play out 
with more complexity. Alcohol-based coercion and blurry consent also 
exist in same — sex relationships and interactions, in some especially 
difficult to escape ways due to the particular stranglehold of 
intoxication culture in queer communities. Although the conditioning 
that men receive in our patriarchal rape culture contributes to higher 
rates of men crossing boundaries without consent, all of us — men, 
women, and others, transgender and non-transgender — have the 
capacity to violate others. But more importantly, we also all have the 
capacity to become allies in the struggle to undermine patriarchy and 
construct a society based on consent. I think that because of this, all 
people who are committed to fighting rape culture and patriarchy can 
benefit from critically examining our patterns of intoxication, and 
discussing ways to be held equally accountable for behavior while 
intoxicated as well as while sober. 

Oppression and Anesthesia 

Maintaining privilege and continuing to oppress a group of people is 
only possible when oppressors can see the people they oppress as less 
than fully human. A major tactic in the dehumanizing process is the 
oppressor's anesthesia, numbing oneself so as to be unable to 
empathize with the people they are relegating to a sub-human status. 
Mab Segrest wrote a moving essay about how a key strategy for 
maintaining white privilege is the anesthesia of white people towards 



1 . To clarify: I don't want my focus on calling out men who drink alcohol to examine their 
behavior to falsely imply that sober men are generally off the hook, not likely to sexually 
assault, and not in need of examination of our patterns of consent and sexuality. That's 
pretty elitist, in terms of how it puts sober men (especially me) on some sort of different, 
less guilty level, and also dangerous, in its implication that we somehow need to be less 
vigilant about owning up to our capacity to violate folks' boundaries. All of us, regardless 
of gender, sexuality, or substance use, have been raised in a rape culture, and in 
particular folks socialized as men have been subjected to especially harmful messages 
about masculinity and violent sexuality. Although alcohol, in combination with media's 
linking of masculinity and intoxication, can be used by men as a tool to facilitate the 
expression of this rape culture, choosing to drink or not drink does not make any of us 
less subject to the socialization we've received, nor less in need of a critical look at 
consent and sexuality.

the suffering of people of color, through distance (out of sight, out of 
mind), rationalization, intoxication, and other methods. Likewise, 
masculinity operates by forcing men to stay detached and impassive in 
the face of physical or emotional pain, setting up sensitivity and 
empathy as "female" (and therefore inferior) characteristics. 
Constructing masculinity as unfeeling — anesthetized — makes 
possible the incredible suffering inflicted by men upon women (and 
other men) through violence, rape, child abuse, denial of access to birth 
control and medical care, the patriarchal nuclear family, and so many 
other means. In this context, it makes perfect sense that intoxication 
would be linked with masculinity. Intoxication often reduces the ability 
of people to empathize with others, an integral part of being an 
oppressor. 

A friend of mine pointed out that when she was in high school, most of 
the kids that she knew who had any idea of what was happening in the 
world were getting completely fucked up as often as they could to 
neutralize the pain of that awareness. I can understand how activists, 
who (theoretically) operate by refusing to ignore the suffering and 
oppression in the world, face an incredible temptation to try and numb 
themselves, even temporarily, to the pain they see and feel and struggle 
against every day. However, I also strongly believe that if everyone in 
our culture was both fully aware of the full extent of how fucked up our 
society is — and refused to simply ignore the pain of that awareness 
though various methods of intoxication and anesthesia, from booze to 
television — then people simply would not stand for it. 

Even providing for the (minority, I think, of) people who are simply 
cruel and hateful, I truly believe that a population honestly facing the 
realities of poverty, oppression, and misery rife in this culture cannot 
do so with both clear heads and clear consciences. When heads are not 
clear, clear consciences become less and less important. When people 
refuse to be numb and truly live the pain of this culture, it motivates 
action. I believe that our task as activists or people who feel a call to 
change this culture is first and foremost to be open to that deep pain, to 
feel it and mourn it and hate it, so that it lights fires in our chests that 
burn for our participation in revolutionary struggle.

Youth Liberation and Sobriety 



The most well-known icon of sXe, the Xs that some edgers draw on 
their hands, originated out of a gesture of solidarity with youth. To this 
day, kids at shows and other all-ages events that serve alcohol often 
have black Xs drawn on their hands by the people taking money at the 
door as a sign that they aren't allowed to drink. In the early 1980's, 
when Minor Threat began bringing the substance-free message to the 
punk scene, people who noticed kids marked with these Xs as symbols 
for prohibition of alcohol started drawing them on their hands, 
regardless of age, to show solidarity with youth and a commitment to 
sobriety. Because of the prevalence of intoxication culture, shows and 
other events often cost more for young kids, or don't allow them in at 
all. The drinking age serves as a legal tool for enforcing segregation and 
discrimination directed towards young folks, setting up an entire 
system around consumption of alcohol that simultaneously devalues 
youth and glorifies intoxication, constructing it as "mature" and 
advanced and all of the other positive traits associated with adulthood. 

As a result, among young people, the mystique of intoxication culture 
leads to semi-secretive consumption of alcohol and other drugs, often to 
a destructive degree. For kids around the ages of eighteen to twenty- 
two or so, just before and after the drinking age, the ability to finally 
partake in the highly coveted "privilege" of intoxication culture leads to 
cults of hyper-intoxication, reinforcing the mystique even more. When 
the destructive consequences of getting fucked up manifest 
dramatically in young folks, as shown by the number of deaths from 
binge drinking, clueless and patronizing adults wag their fingers and 
bemoan "peer pressure" as the cause, when it's blatantly fucking 
obvious that the causes lie in their own actions. 

The entirely adult-constructed mystique around intoxication, 
hypocritical and inconsistent policies promoting potentially fatal 
intoxicants while violently suppressing less harmful ones, and the 
oppression and devaluing of young people in general frequently lead to 
the desire to emulate the destructive fucked up patterns of adult 
intoxication with the vehemence of youth. Fuck "peer pressure" — I've 
felt consistent and unrelenting pressure from every sector of adult 
society to intoxicate myself through every possible means for as long as 
I can remember. Do adults honestly think that a "drug education 
10 



program" in 5th grade and some condescending guest speakers in a 
high school health class would cancel the effects of an entire social 
system based on oppression requiring intoxication and anesthesia to 
survive? 

My decision to abstain totally from intoxication culture has a lot to do 
with my desire for youth liberation. Maybe I don't want the privilege 
that comes with adulthood to destroy my body legally. Maybe I don't 
buy the argument that only adults — being naturally superior to kids, 
according to adult chauvinist logic — are responsible enough to handle 
getting fucked up. I think the impressive thing is being strong enough 
to survive without getting fucked up — if becoming an adult means 
accepting the need to numb myself into accepting the status quo, then 
fuck it, I'm following Peter Pan and never growing up. 

Intoxication and Social Life 

Seriously, one of the reasons why living in a community that drinks 
constantly bugs me is that it makes conversation SO damn boring! I 
can hardly ever hang out in a large group without conversation turning 
for a substantial period of time to drinking, getting fucked up, what so 
and so did when they were fucked up, how fucked up so and so's going 
to get, blah blah blah. Who fucking cares? Are people really so boring 
most of the time that they don't merit conversation without corporate- 
induced altered consciousness? Can we really not think of anything 
more interesting to talk about than our self-destructiveness? What 
about our dreams, our passions, our crazy ideas and schemes, our hopes 
and fears? I hate going to parties where intoxication numbs 
individuality into mush, so that I can have the same mindless banter 
with 100 people but not a conversation of any substance with a single 
person. Am I anti- social for staying home with one good friend or a book 
when that's the alternative? 

Beyond boring conversation, dependence on alcohol limits our social 
lives in other ways. In bar culture, public interaction is limited to 
contexts where we have to buy something in order to spend time with 
other people. It makes us less well equipped to enjoy one another's 
company in ordinary mindsets or without corporate intervention. We 
bond over buying, consuming, numbing, and things rather than 
creating, experiencing, feeling, and personalities. Instead of challenging 

11 



it, we accept the proposition that we need consumer capitalism to be 
able to "loosen up," have a good time, and get past the hang-ups and 
self-restraint that constrain our lives. 

Intoxication and Corporate Culture 

I know a disturbing amount of folks in radical communities who spend 
their entire income on alcohol and tobacco. People who shoplift from the 
local food coop because they don't want to pay for food will head down 
the street to the chain convenience store and pour the tiny bit of money 
that they do have into some of the most wicked fucking corporations in 
operation today. There seems to be an incredible blind spot around 
tobacco and booze with regards to ethical consumption; kids who'll 
demonstrate against Wal-Mart or Exxon for their labor or 
environmental practices will then turn around and buy cigarettes and 
beer from stores that have devastatingly negative impacts on local 
communities and that were produced by companies that are central to 
everything that is awful about global capitalism. Kudos to kids who at 
least make an effort to buy local, grow/brew their own, and such, but 
the industry feeds off of them just as much, knowing that the more 
dependent they are on chemical stimulation the less they'll care where 
it comes from. 

Growing tobacco is incredibly destructive to land; after three years of 
hosting a tobacco crop, soil is so depleted that nothing can be grown 
there for the next twenty. Tobacco (grown by indentured servants and 
slaves) was the single reason why the first English colony in America 
managed to survive, and with increasing numbers of white settlers 
requiring new swaths of land every three years to sustain the colonial 
economy, it's not a stretch to say that tobacco — motivated theft of 
native land was one of the major catalysts for the genocidal campaign 
against the indigenous people of this continent that continues to this 
day. This process continues around the world, as tobacco corporations 
constantly absorb new plots of land to feed the cravings of the millions 
of addicted around the world. To get this land, corporations steal it 
from public lands or indigenous tribes, "buy" it from peasants so 
impoverished by global capitalism that they have no choice but to sell it 
(so that they can be more easily forced into the new factories), or 
convert land that previously grew food crops that actually nourished 
rather than poisoned people. 
12 



In most nations in the global south, tobacco is flue-cured, a labor- 
intensive process that requires massive deforestation; one researcher 
estimated that tobacco cultivation and processing accounted for one of 
every eight trees cut down in underdeveloped countries. As more and 
more land becomes ecologically devastated from tobacco cultivation, the 
cycle accelerates, less and less land is available for food production, and 
more and more deadly chemicals and genetically engineered strains are 
required to grow anything. Tobacco companies offer subsidies and 
technical support to farmers in underdeveloped nations to switch from 
food to tobacco, and since IMF structural adjustment programs have 
decimated public support of agriculture, many farmers have no choice 
but to convert, accelerating hunger within their nation and increasing 
their dependence on the global capitalist market. Tobacco is at the 
heart of the horrifically pathological global system of capitalist 
agriculture that prioritizes the right of First World people to poison 
themselves over the right Third World people to eat. 

Intoxication in Oppressed Communities 

Drugs and alcohol are used as colonial weapons against folks of African 
descent in the United States. Frederick Douglass pointed out in his 
slave narrative that on holidays, masters would encourage slaves to 
drink to excess specifically to skew their perceptions of what freedom 
was and to promote passivity the rest of the year. From absentee-owned 
liquor stores in black neighborhoods to the CIA's introduction of crack 
as a weapon against black communities, white people have profited 
from the economic drain, physical debilitation, and social conflict and 
violence exacerbated by alcohol and drugs in black communities. The 
black revolutionary tradition in the US has strong tendencies towards 
sobriety, from Malcolm X to the Black Panthers to Dead Prez, drawing 
specific links between black oppression and intoxication culture. 

"When a slave was drunk, the slaveholder had no fear 
that he would plan an insurrection! no fear that he 
would escape to the North. It was the sober, thinking 
slave who was dangerous, and needed the vigilance of 
his master to keep him a slave." — Frederick Douglass 



13 



The native communities that survive in North America are almost all 
absolutely devastated by alcoholism. Alcohol abuse has severely 
disrupted what positive community structures have survived the 
European genocide. For the past several hundred years, alcohol was 
used by opportunistic whites as a way to con native people into signing 
"treaties" robbing them of their land, and as an intentional strategy of 
sowing discord into previously unified, harmonious, and sober 
communities. Currently, alcoholism is one of the leading causes of 
death among native people; around reservations that have prohibited 
alcohol, primarily white "drunk towns" have sprung up with dozens of 
bars and ABC stores just past the reservation borders to turn 
indigenous addiction into capitalist profit, often with fatal 
consequences. 

Queer and trans communities struggle with astronomically high rates 
of alcoholism, due both to an attempt to escape the pressure of hiding 
their sexuality from family, friends, and society, and due to the 
emphasis on alcohol as a form of recreation throughout mainstream 
queer culture. Beer companies are among the largest sponsors of 
"Pride" celebrations and advertise extensively in queer publications; in 
most areas of the US, the primary social spaces for queer-friendly (or 
even queer-safe) interaction are bars whose primary function is selling 
intoxication. One of the first specifically gay and lesbian organizations 
in many towns is a chapter of Alcoholic Anonymous. Substance abuse 
rates among queers are also severe, as untold numbers of ravers and 
club queens burn out on cocaine, crystal meth, ecstasy, and other 
substances. The epidemics of AIDS and other STDs continue, in spite of 
the incredible efforts of educators and activists throughout the country, 
largely because of risky sex while intoxicated. For sober queers, 
virtually no physical or social space exists. 

Intoxication and Radical Communities 

The reluctance of "activist" or "anarchist" or "radical" communities to 
acknowledge how fucked up (pun intended) intoxication culture can be 
genuinely baffles me. Ever since I got involved in radical politics, these 
connections have seemed obvious to me, but the fact that so few people 
appeared to agree made me wonder whether perhaps I was the one who 
had it all wrong. Alcohol (ab)use, tobacco smoking, and varying degrees 
of drug use have been central institutions in the lives of the vast 
14 



majority of the radical folks with whom I've worked. Only recently have 
I begun to make connections with other sober radicals apart from 
scattered acquaintances, and nearly all of us relate to the feelings of 
isolation within our communities, alienation from our peers, and 
frustration with the lack of support we feel for sober safe spaces. 

Yet the fact that we're the few, the lonely, and the sober by no means 
indicates that we're the only ones who see or complain about the 
problems caused by intoxication culture's infiltration into radical 
communities. My individual conversations with many distinctly non- 
sober folks often reveal a genuine anxiety about the negative 
consequences of their personal and the scene's social dependence on 
drugs and alcohol. My personal experience and the experience of 
numerous women, people of color, and queer and trans people with 
whom I've discussed the issue confirms to me how hypocritical people 
can be who claim to be fighting oppression yet participate proudly in 
intoxication culture. More and more, this issue seems like the elephant 
in the corner that no one's willing to point out. 

I think it's high time (ha ha) that our communities started meaningful 
dialogues around issues of sobriety and intoxication — and there are 
going to have to be non-sober allies who step up and take active roles 
alongside the substance-free folks for it to work. We need to be 
negotiating agreements for collective houses and spaces, social 
gatherings, shows and events, and other spaces in our lives that respect 
the needs of folks both sober and not, with particular emphasis on 
respecting the requests of women and trans folks, whose needs are 
least frequently considered in developing community standards. This is 
not something that many of our communities are used to, but in my 
opinion it's absolutely essential. This process has the potential to be a 
revolutionary transformation, as we move away from a loosely 
associated group of people who work together to an actual community 
where we respect each others' needs and hold each other accountable. 

Intoxication and "Autonomy" vs. Accountability 

In the process of developing community agreements, some folks may 
feel that they're being denied their "autonomy" their right to live their 
own lives how they want, including the right to get fucked up if they so 
desire. Personally, I wholeheartedly support the right of any individual 

15 



to fuck themselves up with chemicals as much as they want to, without 
sanction from the state, organized religion, or self-righteous zine 
writers. However, I only support that right so long as you contain the 
destructiveness of your choices to yourself as someone wise once said, 
"Your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins." And l"d 
argue that very few people who do choose to get fucked up honestly and 
completely look at how their choices impact others, particularly 
oppressed folks. 

From the financial support of really fucked up corporations, to the 
targeting of people of color and queer communities and the increased 
rates of addiction and devastation in these communities, to the 
relationship between intoxication and patriarchal masculinity, to the 
fucked up behavior towards women that so often arises with 
intoxication... it's NOT just a simple personal choice you make yourself, 
in a bubble, to smoke or drink or take drugs. There's an incredible 
amount of baggage that goes along with the decision to get fucked up 
that activist communities, in my experience, rarely acknowledge. 

Some anarchists see anarchy as the ability to do whatever they want 
without having to be accountable to anyone else for their actions. I 
personally think that that kind of attitude is just the standard 
American "rugged individualism" bullshit repackaged as a faux-radical 
alternative, because it doesn't challenge the fundamental alienation 
from each other we suffer under capitalism and the state. If our society 
replaces genuine community with consumer culture, authority, and 
oppression, that kind of anarchism simply rejects any idea of 
community at all. For me, anarchism is about replacing the false 
community of the state and consumer culture with a community based 
on mutual aid rather than competition, gift economy rather than 
capitalism, and collective agreements based on full consent and 
voluntary association rather than rules or laws based on state coercion 
and violence. Instead of being accountable to authority, I want us to 
actually be accountable to each other. A pretty important part of that is 
being able to come together as radical communities and have 
conversations about how alcohol and drugs impact our work, our 
spaces, our relationships, and our unity, to figure out what sorts of 
agreements and boundaries make sense for us. 



16 



As a perfect example of the kind of community-based response to 
alcohol and drugs I'm talking about, look at the Zapatista movement in 
southern Mexico. During the weeks I spent in Chiapas learning about 
their struggle, I learned something that most of the kids in the 
Subcommandante Marcos t-shirts don't mention^ all autonomous 
Zapatista communities are 100 percent alcohol free. No alcoholic 
beverages are sold or consumed in any of the autonomous 
municipalities, and on the signs indicating that you are entering 
Zapatista territory in rebellion against the Mexican government, many 
specifically say that these are alcohol and drug free spaces. I learned 
also that the reason for this is because it was a central demand of the 
women involved in discussion about the new society they were building. 
Mexican women feel most acutely the effects of alcoholism, in terms of 
domestic and sexual abuse, and because being financially dependent on 
men in a patriarchal society means that when husbands spend the 
Family's money on booze, the wife has to struggle to pay for food for her 
and her children. The director of a feminist collective in San Cristobal 
with whom I spoke said that male alcohol abuse is one of the central 
problems facing women in Mexico today. 

Consequently, the communities agreed to the demand of the women for 
drug and alcohol Free communities, in spite of the fact that many of the 
men wanted to be able to drink. Some villages even split around this 
issue. Currently, the no-alcohol agreement is enforced by the 
community, and it is almost always respected; folks who refuse to 
respect the prohibition are ostracized or, if they refuse to change their 
behavior, face expulsion from the community (incidentally, it's almost 
unheard of for it to reach that point). A traveler I met who had passed 
through Guatemala and parts of southern Mexico on his way to 
Chiapas mentioned that in most of the rural villages he'd passed 
through, the majority of the men would be drunk by 10 AM, every day. 
The Zapatista communities, he observed, had a completely different 
vibe; people got far more done and treated each other with more 
respect. 

I mention this example for a number of reasons. For one, I think that 
many anarchaholics who supposedly idolize the Zapatista struggle 
could stand to learn about how those communities deal with alcohol 
and drugs. Also, I suspect that a lot of North American anarcho folks 
might find such a prohibition "authoritarian" or worse. This gets at the 



17 



heart of how I see the difference between hyper-individualist and 
community-based anarchism. There's nothing authoritarian, in my 
opinion, about an agreement reached collectively to abstain from 
individual behaviors that the community collectively decides are 
harmful to itself as a whole. The key to the Zapatista autonomous 
project is that it's totally based on voluntary association; no community 
or individual is forced to participate. Many villages have chosen not to 
be an official part of the network of autonomous municipalities if they 
don't consent to all of the agreements made by the Zapatista 
movement, and that's fine. 

Furthermore, the Zapatitsa agreements on alcohol are an example of 
actually acknowledging and directly respecting the autonomy of 
women. How many anarchist groups or communities in the US who 
claim to be feminist have actually adopted the desires and needs of 
women into their practice — or even bothered to ask? All in all, the 
people involved in that struggle decided to place the good of their 
community, as determined through consensus, above the unlimited 
"freedom" of individuals to do as they please. I would challenge our 
anarchist communities in the north to think critically about our 
priorities and grapple with these difficult questions about individual 
and community, autonomy and accountability. 

Story #1 

My primary activist community when I first moved to the town where I 
now live operated out of a collective bookstore, an awesome space full of 
radicals working on positive projects. Just a month or two after I'd 
become very involved, I was invited to attend a retreat with the board 
of directors at a beach house several hours away from where we lived. 
I'd heard people joking about how much alcoholic fun they were going 
to have there, which immediately made me feel unsafe. The facts that I 
don't drive and would have no way to get away if I felt unsafe, didn't 
know many of the people involved very well yet, and was the only 
young person all made me very nervous about the situation, and I 
expressed my misgivings to a friend who worked at the store. She 
assured me that there wouldn't be much alcohol, that people wouldn't 
be getting too drunk, and that if I felt unsafe she would be available for 
me. With that assurance, I somewhat reluctantly came along. 



18 



On Saturday night, two people left to get alcohol, returning with four 
cases of beer and several bottles of liquor. Everyone except for me was 
an adult and everyone except for me drank pretty heavily that night, 
including my friend who said that she would be available for me. I felt 
very uncomfortable, but I didn't have any way to leave, any idea where 
I was, or any alternatives for entertainment, so I just sat through it. 
The next morning we got started with our work hours later than we'd 
planned to because folks were hung over and wanted to sleep. When we 
debriefed at the end of the retreat, I mentioned that one thing I would 
have changed was to have less alcohol, but I didn't feel comfortable 
enough to express bow seriously I felt alienated and unsafe, or ask for 
ways to hold the group accountable next time. No one discussed it 
further or followed up with me about my discomfort. I don't know how 
to breach the subject without putting people on the defensive, and I feel 
like I'm being selfish, whiny, hyper-sensitive, a "party pooper," or anti- 
democratic by expressing how I feel about it. I don't necessarily think 
that it would be fair to ask the group to completely ban alcohol at the 
retreat, especially given that every single person but me of a group of 
fifteen or so enjoys drinking, yet the only alternative seems to be the 
default of me faking smiles and sitting uncomfortably through 
situations that make me feel unsafe and alone. 

One way to address such a situation for sober folks to feel safe and able 
to still participate might be to ensure in advance that at least one or 
two other people will be there who will commit to stay sober for the 
night (whether or not they usually do). That way, the group could still 
drink if they chose to do so, while the sober person can still have a way 
to feel safe with someone, or leave if necessary and not feel totally 
isolated. I would suggest finding someone you trust a lot and know will 
be committed to an evening of sobriety, and to be sure to ask them to 
commit in advance, so that they haven't built intoxication into their 
expectations for the activity. Other possibilities include asking all of the 
people involved to make it an alcohol-free occasion, particularly if it's a 
small group or event, or simply declining to attend and making clear 
that the presence of drugs and alcohol is the reason why you're not 
coming. Whatever you decide, it will probably work best to calmly and 
specifically explain your discomfort, and to take care not to judge or 
make assumptions about other people's behavior. If people committed 
to sobriety stop making excuses, staying home, or remaining silent 
when they feel unsafe, hopefully we can start a dialogue about issues of 



19 



intoxication in activist communities that will help create social space 
for substance-free folks. 

Story #2 

I attended an environmental defense action camp for a week with about 
150 kids in the mountains. I was pretty nervous about going out there 
with no way to get out of the situation and a big crew of rowdy booze- 
loving primitivists, but I decided it was more important to go and to 
learn the skills I could learn. Things went surprisingly well for most of 
the week; halfway through there was an alcohol-light campfire sing- 
along that was a blast. On the last night, there was a big party 
planned, with all sorts of preparations made for multiple kegs and beer 
runs and home brew and more. Amazingly, the organizers were really 
concerned with ensuring that the folks who wanted to remain sober had 
a safe space, and planned to make a clear community agreement in 
advance with specific dry zones, etc. The full-group meeting broke off 
for dinner before the conversation could take place, so a group of fifteen 
or so folks interested in seeing that sober spaces were secured stayed 
late and talked through options! even more amazingly, almost all of the 
group were folks who were planning to drink, but wanted to be allies to 
the sober folks. After a frustrating and long set of negotiations, a 
separate campfire area that was to be not only alcohol free, but only for 
folks who had not had any alcohol that night, was set up, with 
individuals committing to gather wood and dig the pit. I was pretty 
thrilled, having never before been in a space where people even 
acknowledged that sober people had valid needs, let alone worked hard 
to create a distinct safe space and make it a priority. 

So I hung out that evening at the sober campfire... along with about 
five or six others. We were a pretty low-key bunch, and I for one felt 
distinctly glum. It was nice to have the company, but I couldn't shake 
the feeling of being quarantined. We were only a few hundred yards 
away from the massive drunken bonfire, with over a hundred kids 
hollering and stomping about, though none of them could come to our 
fire, and most of us didn't feel remotely comfortable going over to 
theirs, even though most of our friends and crushes and lovers were 
over there. After thirty or forty-five minutes, most of us had drifted off 
to our tents, the screams of the revelers echoing in our ears. I sat 



20 



morosely by the dwindling embers for a long while, trying to figure out 
why I felt so dejected. Isn't this what I wanted, our own separate "safe 
space"? I felt guilty for not sufficiently appreciating what was 
undoubtedly the most comprehensive effort to address my needs that 
had ever been made in a radical space. Finally, as the main party in the 
distance tailed of into isolated voices fighting and cursing or sobbing, I 
ambled off to bed, feeling as lonely and isolated as ever. 

That experience represented a mixture of positives and negatives, and 
could point towards some constructive solutions. On the plus side, 
organizers and participants (at least a number of them) did make a 
substantial effort during the day to plan a sober alternative space that 
would be safe; on the minus side, the larger group wasn't engaged in 
that process, and most folks in fact were simply informed that if they 
planned to drink, they weren't permitted to go in a certain area, 
reinforcing the absolute sober/ not dichotomy which felt isolating to me. 
On the plus side, many non-sober allies stepped up to make sure that 
safe spaces were provided, which I think is crucially important; on the 
minus side, the allies didn't extend their support into actually 
participating with the sober folks and abstaining themselves, except for 
one person, and not many of the sober Folks for whom the space was 
being designed actually participated in its planning. On the plus side, 
the space was created and respected; on the minus side, there were 
hardly any folks there, and it wasn't much fun, though everyone agreed 
they were glad it was there. The proximity to the "main" drunken 
party, the severely disproportionate number of non-sober to sober folks, 
the lack of actual activities beyond a space and a campfire, the feeling 
of being quarantined, and the general lack of support among many 
camp participants (excepting the organizers and wonderful allies) made 
the reality of the sober space fall far short of the expectations. 

To improve the situation in the future, a few things that could be 
changed: 

1. Ensure broader participation in the process of making sober-safe 
spaces; make it a part of full-group discussion, make a caucus of the 
folks who actually plan to stay sober a central part of the process, and 
figure out so me mechanism for accountability to that caucus. 



21 



2. When circumstances permit, make the actual space far enough away 
physically from the drunken ground zero so that it doesn't feel like 
we're being pushed just outside the "real" fun, and we don't feel the 
need to defend the territory as our only few square feet of safe space. 

3. Plan not just spaces, but activities for sober folks — be creative and 
flexible, whatever folks think could be interesting and outrageous. Spin 
the bottle, treasure hunts, hide and seek, twister, bike scavenger hunts, 
dance parties, anything! The idea is not only to make it more fun for 
the sober folks, but to make an incentive for some of the not-always- 
sober folks to commit to being sober for the evening so that they can 
hang out with the fun group. This can be the best kind of substance- 
free advocacy — showing that the sober kids can party hardy even 
better than the drunks! 

Conclusion: The Beginning? 

Hopefully some of the ideas in this zine have been helpful, or 
provocative, or maybe showed things in a different light, or gave you 
some starting points for addressing the concerns of sober folks in your 
community. I wouldn't expect most folks to accept or agree with 
everything I've written, but with luck it'll open a few minds and hearts 
and start some debates. Also, some of us are thinking towards 
developing a sober support network to share resources, develop 
propaganda, start conversations in our communities, identify safe 
spaces, and support each other when we feel isolated. It's a long way 
towards a less fucked up world, but with honesty, dialogue, and each 
others support we can begin heading that way. Until then, 

with love and rage,

Rftsrmard: Towards a less Fucked 
Up World: Five Years and Counting 

In the five years since I originally released the zine Towards a Less 
Fucked Up World: Sobriety and Anarchist Struggle, I've had hundreds 



22. 



of conversations with people who read the zine and felt moved by it in 
one way or another. When I wrote and published it, I never would have 
expected it to resonate with such a wide range of folks. But the fact that 
it has shows me that there's a tremendous desire to confront the 
realities of substance use and intoxication in radical communities. In 
this short essay I'll talk a bit about how the zine came together and 
how folks have responded to it, and frame this in the context of other 
discussions about radical sobriety that have taken place in punk/ 
anarchist spaces. Hopefully tracing this trajectory will provide some 
context for the potential for radical sobriety within US anarchist 
resistance through the lens of one zine and its reception. 

How It Came Together 

The ideas that eventually coalesced into Towards a Less Fucked Up 
World began to take form when I was seventeen or eighteen and 
became increasingly involved in broader currents of radical and 
anarchist activity. Attending conferences, gatherings, mass 
mobilizations, and countless shows and potlucks, I began to notice 
patterns of drug and alcohol use that often reinforced rather than 
challenged oppression. My personal decision to remain drug and alcohol 
-free crystallized along with my politics; the more certain I felt about 
circling my "A"s, the more confident I felt in my sobriety. But to my 
surprise and frustration, my comrades in struggle rarely saw things the 
same way. The question that always perplexed me most was this : why 
don't radical folks ask the same kinds of critical and self-critical 
questions about our alcohol and drug use that we ask about so many 
other aspects of our lives and behavior? What's so different about 
intoxication, to the degree where just mentioning it can provoke such 
intense defensiveness, dismissal, or ridicule? 

Coming to understand these reactions meant grappling with the impact 
of sXe amongst punks, anarchists, and radicals in the US. When I was 
growing up, I only knew a single self-identified sXe kid. He was a pretty 
homophobic jerk while he claimed edge, then after about a year washed 
the X's off his hands and started getting wasted with the rest of the 
punks. So apart from my interaction with a single (thoroughly 
unimpressive) sXer, I was never connected to or even aware of sXe as a 
scene or movement — I never even knew there was such a thing as sXe 



23 



music until I was probably nineteen! I'd only heard the term used as a 
synonym for sober. 

Then as I became more involved in punk and anarchist circles, I started 
hearing the horror stories about sXe kids who harassed or beat up 
drinkers or drug users, played out hardcore masculinity to its idiotic 
extreme, and displayed incredibly judgmental and obnoxious attitudes. 
When confronted with my decision to be intentionally sober, many 
people I met lacked any context for a conscious radical sobriety. To 
them sobriety was solely connected to a violent, cult-like hardcore 
identity. As I confronted the reputation that sXe had acquired amongst 
many radicals and anarchists, little by little the defensiveness I 
encountered became more understandable. 

But as I started meeting actual sXe hardcore kids, most of whom were 
invariably friendly and respectful, I began to doubt how true all the 
stories were. Were defensive drinkers just creating a sXe straw man 
onto whom they could project all of their nightmare fantasies of crazed 
puritanical anti-drug boneheads? Was their emphasis on the myth of 
the violently judgmental sXe kid really just a means of avoiding a 
critical look at their own intoxication habits and how they impacted our 
scene? While I certainly don't deny that some folks have had negative 
experiences with individual sXe kids, they can't possibly outweigh the 
innumerable negative experiences all of us have had with the 
obnoxiously intoxicated. 

At the same time, I wondered whether I was starting to embody some of 
those projected qualities. When I discussed my choices with others, was 
I conveying them in a way that came across as judgmental, preachy, or 
confrontational? By labeling my decision to be entirely sober for 
political as well as personal reasons with the term "sXe," was I placing 
myself in a trajectory guaranteed to promote defensiveness? Was I 
shutting down dialogue rather than opening it up? 

Although the solidarity I discovered with other individuals who claimed 
edge provided some sense of support, more often than not I found that 
using the term to describe myself made it harder rather than easier to 
connect with the people with whom I really wanted to discuss issues of 
intoxication culture. As discussion with drinkers and drug users about 
how to negotiate healthy and mutually respectful community norms 



24 



became increasingly important to me, I found myself shying away from 
the sXe label. But I wanted to convey that my sobriety stemmed from 
my convictions as an anarchist and a feminist, not just from an 
individual preference, yet without the having to rely on the problematic 
legacy of sXe to do so. 

So I wrote Towards a Less Fucked Up World in an effort to pry the 
discussion about sobriety and intoxication away from the context of sXe 
and the mythology surrounding it. I wanted to discuss sobriety as a 
politically motivated lifestyle choice, not simply as a personal 
preference without collective or political dimensions, while also 
avoiding making it into an identity or a scene or a polarizing or 
moralistic thing. It turned out to be more difficult than I'd expected! 
Fortunately, the responses I got to the zine showed that most people 
who read it were able to see past the controversy around sXe to the 
underlying issues I wanted to address. 

Responses and Critiques 

The most common response I've received from readers has been a 
feeling of affirmation^ folks related that the arguments and stories in 
the zine resonated with their own thoughts and experiences in ways 
they'd never heard articulated before. This surprised me on two levels^ 
first, that so many people were thinking about the same issues and 
feeling similar frustration and alienation; and also that there were so 
few other people talking or writing about it. Another surprise : most 
people who've written me about my zine aren't totally sober themselves, 
but still felt that the zine spoke to them and their experiences. 
Certainly a number of sober/sXe folks have appreciated its ideas and 
used it for outreach; but by far and away the majority of the folks who 
wrote me did so not from that perspective, but from looking critically at 
their own intoxication and the culture supporting it. In addition to folks 
from within the young punk/anarchist/activist milieu, I've also gotten 
mail from mainstream college kids, lonely small-town teenagers, older 
alcoholics in recovery, and a variety of other folks. 

The most vigorous and spot-on critiques I heard dealt with the section I 
wrote about intoxication and patriarchal masculinity. The section that 
now appears as "Masculinity, Rape Culture, and Intoxication" looked 



25 



very different in the initial edition; it contained language that framed 
sexual and partner violence in simplistic and inaccurately gender- 
specific terms, represented sex workers in a disrespectful way, and 
didn't offer any trigger warning to brace folks for my rather abrasive 
discussion of sensitive issues. After a variety of conversations about the 
flaws of the original section, I began circulating an insert that 
addressed the critiques and reworked the section with the zine as I 
continued to distribute it. The section as it appears in this anthology 
represents substantial revisions that came out of many difficult and 
important conversations, to whose initiators I gratefully owe a much 
more nuanced critique of the connections between intoxication, 
masculinity, and violence. 

Some other miscellaneous critiques : several people suggested that I 
could have spoken in more depth about the importance of sober spaces 
for people in recovery from addiction, and about harm reduction ideas 
and radical recovery models. Some wanted me to elaborate more on 
how to create sober spaces that weren't just quarantines but could 
effectively integrate drinkers and non-drinkers into fun alcohol-free 
environments; they also suggested avoiding the term "safe space" since 
it implies a fear of drinking rather than an aversion, which polarizes 
people more than necessary. Others wanted more acknowledgment of 
home brewing and growing as alternatives to capitalist control of 
addiction. A few countered my historical examples about sobriety in 
radical movements by mentioning the ways that intoxication has 
played into histories of resistance, from drunken workers riots to drug 
use in 1960s counterculture. Some found my treatment of drinkers and 
drug users far too judgmental and unlikely to stimulate the kind of 
dialogue and self-reflection necessary to break out of patterns of denial, 
blame, and judgment. All of these comments and others I appreciated 
and thought over; some are reflected in changes in this edition, other I 
hope to incorporate into future issues of the zine, and a few I decided to 
leave unchanged with the recognition that the arguments and tone are 
provocative, intentionally so, and will always provoke criticism. 

Fortunately, the zine has provoked much more than criticism — its 
inspired dialogue and action, too, as I've heard in stories from people 
around the US and beyond. In Maine, a group of punks copied and 
distributed the zine and then hosted a sober potluck to discuss the 
issues it raised and how they related to the local scene. One group of 



26 



Canadian anarchists altered the direction of the community radical 
library and show space they were establishing after reading the zine, 
deciding to promote the space as an explicitly sober social alternative 
for radicals. In North Carolina, one reader started a weekly sobriety 
discussion group at a radical community space. Every other week, the 
meeting was open to anyone and discussion revolved around the role of 
intoxication in their town's radical scene and how to create alternative 
spaces; on the alternate weeks there was a closed meeting for folks in 
recovery from addiction who wanted to support one another from an 
explicitly radical perspective. These and a variety of other inspiring 
stories have convinced me that radicals long to challenge the role of 
intoxication culture in communities of struggle. 

The Future of Radical Sobriety 

In the last few years I've also observed shifts in anarchist culture 
towards breaking the stranglehold of intoxication culture in our scenes 
— in zines, workshops, discussions, and many other formats, we've 
spoken out about our complex experiences with drugs, alcohol, 
addiction, and sobriety individually and collectively. 

Since the release of Towards a Less Fucked Up World, a variety of zines 
have emerged in the US addressing different aspects of intoxication, 
sobriety, and resistance : the following are just some of the ones I've 
read and enjoyed. Prescription for Change offers a personal account of a 
recovering addict, insightful critiques of the AA model, and a nuanced 
outsider's take on sXe. Distress #1-2 offers crucial harm reduction info 
and analyses of how intoxication relates to mental health. Out from the 
Shadows #1-2 (successor to Encuentro zine) blends a militant vegan 
sXe and green anarchist perspective on radical sobriety with a 
passionate love for sXe hardcore, and links struggles against 
intoxication culture with resistance to civilization. Stash describes 
personal stories of addiction and recovery as well as domestic and 
sexual violence while discussing the radical community's role in 
perpetuating or challenging these dynamics. Twinkle Pig #3.5 traces 
one sXer's personal history of exclusion, self-redefinition, and political 
critiques of intoxication culture. Total Destruction #1-4 focuses on 
anarcho-communist theory, prisoner solidarity, and eco-resistance, 
from a vegan sXe perspective. Cuddle Puddles #1S presents a vegan 
sXe anarchist standpoint on a variety of political and lifestyles issues 

27 



— #1 addresses the continuing value of sXe. Ruffsketch humorously 
chronicles the animal rights activism and cross-country travels of a 
vegan sXe hooligan. These and many other zines document the 
groundswell of thought and action taking place in radical scenes around 
intoxication and sobriety. 

This explosion of discussion of radical sobriety in print has continued 
face to face at radical gatherings. My first such experience took place 
just after the publication of Towards a Less Fucked Up World in early 
2004, at the National Conference on Organized Resistance in 
Washington, DC, a large yearly anti-authoritarian conference. I 
presented with three friends a workshop titled "Beyond a Culture of 
Oblivion" that discussed the potential of radical sobriety contributing to 
anarchist resistance. To our surprise, the workshop was packed out the 
door, with well over 100 people attempting to squeeze into a tightly 
cramped classroom, demonstrating the widespread desire for dialogue 
around intoxication in radical communities. We presented some basic 
critiques of intoxication, framed by stories from our experience, 
discussed the role of sobriety and sober individuals in various radical 
movements from different times and places, and tried our best to 
facilitate a discussion about the impact that drug and alcohol use had 
on the different communities of struggle represented by the folks 
present. The room included everyone from cranky sXers with "Fuck You 
for Smoking" hoodies to intransigent drinkers and drug users who 
defended their choices vehemently, and at times antagonism surfaced. 
But overall, most participants seemed grateful just to have a space to 
openly vent their frustrations with both the stranglehold of intoxication 
culture on their scenes as well as the inadequacy of judgmental, 
cliquish sXe scenes as viable alternatives. We distributed copies of 
Wasted Indeed! and Towards a Less Fucked Up World, and encouraged 
folks to continue the conversation in their scenes at home. Ultimately, 
we were surprised by how successfully the workshop had gone and 
encouraged by the enthusiasm for addressing the issues constructively. 

Since then, workshops and discussions about intoxication and sobriety 
have popped up with increasing frequency at radical gatherings. Folks 
came together to discuss these issues at events ranging from the 
Richmond Zine Fair to the Crimethlnc. Convergence, from the C.L.I.T. 
Fest (a feminist punk festival) to the Earth First! rendezvous, and 
numerous others. I personally helped facilitate workshops at two 



28 



radical queer/ trans gatherings, the Florida United Queers and 
Trannies conference and the Sweaty Southern Radical Queer and 
Trans Convergence in North Carolina; the latter operated as an 
entirely sober gathering, the first queer/trans-specific conference I'd 
ever heard of doing so, and to our surprise the organizers received 
almost total support from the participants in respecting the drug/ 
alcohol-free agreement. More and more gatherings create sober spaces 
for folks who want or need them, encouraging drug- and alcohol-free 
social events, and including discussions of substance use in broader 
guidelines around consent and respect. This represents a subtle but 
important shift in radical culture towards challenging the 
entrenchment of intoxication culture and opening up space for radical 
sobriety without imposing it top-down as a norm. 

Interestingly, most of these discussions and spaces of which I've been a 
part haven't used sXe as the primary framework for conceptualizing the 
choice to be sober. In fact, many folks said things like "I'm not sXe, 
but..." to describe their choices to be sober or critical of intoxication 
culture, which indicates the negative associations many US punks and 
anarchists still hold with sXe. I think it's premature to sound the death 
knell of sXe, or start talking about "post-edge" radical sobriety — I 
think this anthology makes clear that sXe still holds power and 
relevance for a lot of people around the world. But clearly we should 
embrace a variety of different possible ways to forge radically sober 
identities, including sXe but not limited by it. In my opinion, whatever 
one's relationship to the phenomenon of sXe may be, the underlying 
critiques and positive alternative visions remain as relevant today as 
they were during the days of Minor Threat. I hope that my zine, this 
anthology, and all of the conversations that come from them will help 
us find the tools we need to fight oppression and domination culture 
tooth and nail while never failing to love and support each other along 
the way.
